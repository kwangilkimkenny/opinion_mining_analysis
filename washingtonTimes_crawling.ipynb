       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nLast week, when people in America used to leave their homes (remember that?), I was finishing up a big household project and stopped off at Lowe’s (every project I do requires at least 17 trips to the hardware store).\\nI walked in, wearing some scuzzy jeans and a paint-splotched CNN shirt (which I only wear for painting), grabbed a cart and then stopped to pick up a sanitizing wipe. I swabbed off my filthy hands and the cart handle (following a stern directive from my wife), and was getting ready to pick up my supplies.\\nJust then a realllly filthy workman rolled in. He saw me swabbing away, hesitated, then walked over and grabbed his own wipe. Now, this guy probably never even knew there was a sanitation station in the hardware store and certainly didn’t look like the kind of guy who’d ever used one before, but there he was — there we were.\\nAnd therein lies my point (I knew I’d get to one eventually): This ain’t China. We don’t eat bats. And even a grubby day laborer and a guy in a shirt Jackson Pollock might’ve worn will take a moment to clean their hands (and make sure, on this dangerous day, that he doesn’t pick up — or put down — any germs).\\nSo for me, the numbers being bandied around just don’t make any sense.\\nThe latest coronavirus, COVID-19, is bad, but 150 million Americans infected? That is what Congress’ in-house doctor told Capitol Hill staffers at a close-door meeting last week.\\nA recent projection from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had even more alarming numbers.\\nWorst-case scenario, COVID-19 could infect between up to 214 million people over a period of more than a year — and kill as many as 1.7 million Americans.\\nThe New York Times used an even more dire model: 2.1 million dead.\\nLet’s back up a second. China has a population of 1,437,722,468 as of Tuesday, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.\\nCOVID-19 was born there (ah, bat eaters), with the first case being diagnosed on Dec. 1.\\nOn Tuesday, there were 81,054 confirmed cases of the virus, according to Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\\nOf those, 68,798 recovered, while 3,230 people died (the remainder were still active cases).\\nSo that means the infection rate in China was just .006%. How, then, are the “experts” forecasting that well more than 50% of the 320 million people in America — where people already wash their hands incessantly and use Purell nonstop — will be infected?\\nAgain, look at the numbers. The virus pounded China from December through the third week of February — more than 10 weeks in all — before it leveled off (if you can believe the communist leaders’ claim).\\nIn the Hubei province, just more than 11% of the nearly 60 million residents were infected. And that was ground zero.\\nThe spread of COVID-19 in China began leveling off a week before February ended. It topped 80,000 on March 1, but 14 days later it was still less than 81,000. The curve had flattened.\\nBut let’s go to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for the final word.\\n“I think we really need to be careful with those kinds of predictions, because that’s based on a model,” Dr. Fauci said at a congressional hearing last week. “All models are as good as the assumptions that you put into the model … it’s unpredictable. So, testing now is not going to tell me how many cases you are going to have. What will tell you what you’re going to have will be how you respond to it with containment and mitigation,” he said.\\nDr. Fauci also said the breathless media tends to report on the higher end of ranges predicted by models. “Remember the model during the Ebola outbreak said you could have as many as a million [cases]. We didn’t have a million,” he said.\\nNo, instead, two people died in the United States from Ebola in 2014. Both contracted the disease overseas. Two more contracted the disease in the United States — both survived.\\nOn Tuesday, the United States had 5,702 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 94 deaths (48 of those in Washington state alone). The numbers will undoubtedly go up — likely by a lot.\\nBut President Trump has taken swift action to cut off the influx of foreigners from countries teeming with infection and on Monday laid out stringent new guidelines to halt the upward curve.\\nAmericans appear to be taking the directives seriously, So, time will tell if it all works.\\nBut 150 million infected? A million dead? Right now, those numbers just don’t seem to add up.\\nLet’s hope they never do.\\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

And even a grubby day laborer and a guy in a shirt Jackson Pollock might’ve worn will take a moment to clean their hands (and make sure, on this dangerous day, that he doesn’t pick up — or put down — any germs).\\nSo for me, the numbers being bandied around just don’t make any sense.\\nThe latest coronavirus, COVID-19, is bad, but 150 million Americans infected? That is what Congress’ in-house doctor told Capitol Hill staffers at a close-door meeting last week.\\nA recent projection from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had even more alarming numbers.\\nWorst-case scenario, COVID-19 could infect between up to 214 million people over a period of more than a year — and kill as many as 1.7 million Americans.\\nThe New York Times used an even more dire model: 2.1 million dead.\\nLet’s back up a second. China has a population of 1,437,722,468 as of Tuesday, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.\\nCOVID-19 was born there (ah, bat eaters), with the first case being diagnosed on Dec. 1.\\nOn Tuesday, there were 81,054 confirmed cases of the virus, according to Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\\nOf those, 68,798 recovered, while 3,230 people died (the remainder were still active cases).\\nSo that means the infection rate in China was just .006%. How, then, are the “experts” forecasting that well more than 50% of the 320 million people in America — where people already wash their hands incessantly and use Purell nonstop — will be infected?\\nAgain, look at the numbers. The virus pounded China from December through the third week of February — more than 10 weeks in all — before it leveled off (if you can believe the communist leaders’ claim).\\nIn the Hubei province, just more than 11% of the nearly 60 million residents were infected. And that was ground zero.\\nThe spread of COVID-19 in China began leveling off a week before February ended. It topped 80,000 on March 1, but 14 days later it was still less than 81,000. The curve had flattened.\\nBut let’s go to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for the final word.\\n“I think we really need to be careful with those kinds of predictions, because that’s based on a model,” Dr. Fauci said at a congressional hearing last week. “All models are as good as the assumptions that you put into the model … it’s unpredictable. So, testing now is not going to tell me how many cases you are going to have. What will tell you what you’re going to have will be how you respond to it with containment and mitigation,” he said.\\nDr. Fauci also said the breathless media tends to report on the higher end of ranges predicted by models. “Remember the model during the Ebola outbreak said you could have as many as a million [cases]. We didn’t have a million,” he said.\\nNo, instead, two people died in the United States from Ebola in 2014. Both contracted the disease overseas. Two more contracted the disease in the United States — both survived.\\nOn Tuesday, the United States had 5,702 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 94 deaths (48 of those in Washington state alone). The numbers will undoubtedly go up — likely by a lot.\\nBut President Trump has taken swift action to cut off the influx of foreigners from countries teeming with infection and on Monday laid out stringent new guidelines to halt the upward curve.\\nAmericans appear to be taking the directives seriously, So, time will tell if it all works.\\nBut 150 million infected? A million dead? Right now, those numbers just don’t seem to add up.\\nLet’s hope they never do.\\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nYouTube couldn’t have picked a worse time to go into censorship mode.\\nThe American people are sick and tired of the randomness with which they’re being asked to comply with government dictates surrounding COVID-19, and of the ever-changing and outright false numbers on the coronavirus counts coming from hospitals that are then used to justify additional crackdowns on civil liberties. So they’ve begun to ask questions, challenge the status quo and even, in some cases, in some states, protest. And that is good.\\nSome doctors, too.\\nA couple of doctors in particular — Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, from Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California — cut a video and outright called the government’s ongoing unconstitutional activities, well, unconstitutional. And that is good, as well.\\nBut YouTube just pulled the doctors’ video.\\nYouTube just censored the doctors’ speech.\\nYouTube, owned by Google, just blacked out the doctors’ voices from their widely watched social media platform.\\nWhy?\\nThat doesn’t make the doctors’ message disappear.\\nIt only embeds it further in the minds of the millions who’ve already heard it. It only raises the red flags that have been raised in recent days over concerns about government’s ongoing chipping of citizens’ individual rights due to COVID-19 — it only raises these red flags higher.\\nYouTube explained the censorship this way: “We quickly remove flagged content that violate our Community Guidelines, including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local healthy authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance. … “\\nBlah, blah, yada, yada. Typical YouTube stuff.\\nAnd since, 23ABC News in Bakersfield has\\xa0appealed YouTube’s removal of the doctors’ video.\\nBut this whole stifling of opinion and free expression is a dark blot on America. And it comes at a time when dark blots are everywhere.\\nNot only is censorship un-American.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nYouTube couldn’t have picked a worse time to go into censorship mode.\\nThe American people are sick and tired of the randomness with which they’re being asked to comply with government dictates surrounding COVID-19, and of the ever-changing and outright false numbers on the coronavirus counts coming from hospitals that are then used to justify additional crackdowns on civil liberties. So they’ve begun to ask questions, challenge the status quo and even, in some cases, in some states, protest. And that is good.\\nSome doctors, too.\\nA couple of doctors in particular — Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, from Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California — cut a video and outright called the government’s ongoing unconstitutional activities, well, unconstitutional. And that is good, as well.\\nBut YouTube just pulled the doctors’ video.\\nYouTube just censored the doctors’ speech.\\nYouTube, owned by Google, just blacked out the doctors’ voices from their widely watched social media platform.\\nWhy?\\nThat doesn’t make the doctors’ message disappear.\\nIt only embeds it further in the minds of the millions who’ve already heard it. It only raises the red flags that have been raised in recent days over concerns about government’s ongoing chipping of citizens’ individual rights due to COVID-19 — it only raises these red flags higher.\\nYouTube explained the censorship this way: “We quickly remove flagged content that violate our Community Guidelines, including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local healthy authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance. … “\\nBlah, blah, yada, yada. Typical YouTube stuff.\\nAnd since, 23ABC News in Bakersfield has\\xa0appealed YouTube’s removal of the doctors’ video.\\nBut this whole stifling of opinion and free expression is a dark blot on America. And it comes at a time when dark blots are everywhere.\\nNot only is censorship un-American. Not only is the shutdown of free expression contrary to the First Amendment, and the core American principle of individual rights coming from God, not government.\\nBut on COVID-19, at this moment in time, at a place in history where Americans are being told to stay home, stay off the streets — except, say, to shop at Walmart or to buy marijuana — and to listen to the government’s orders, and oh yes, shhh, to please ignore the fact the orders are based on faulty computer models and false hospital reports, well, it seems counterintuitive to the cause of calming the citizenry to clamp a couple of doctors’ doctorly-based COVID-19 analyses.\\nThese are doctors, for crying out loud.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nHow do you like being under house arrest? A bit of an overstatement — perhaps — but not by much. How much longer are you willing to endure it? The COVID-19 crisis has caused government — federal, state and local — to strip away many basic liberties. Do you think the politicians will give them all back now that they have tasted the power to corral the people while being met with little more than a whimper?\\nWe are told we will get our liberties back on the basis of “what the data and models show” — whatever that might mean. The main model that the government was using a couple of weeks ago projected there would be 240,000 deaths in the United States, even after all of the mitigation efforts. After a series of revisions, their projected total deaths is now approximately 60,000. Sixty thousand deaths is terrible, but almost 3 million Americans die each year from all causes (a little less than 1 percent of the population).\\nIf the new 60,000 projected COVID-19 deaths is at all accurate, it will mean that about one out of every 5,500 Americans will die from the virus. Less than 1 percent of the COVID-19 deaths will occur among those who are younger than 34. Yet, if you are 65 or older, your chance of dying from COVID-19 is one in 1,250, but your chance of dying from all causes is already one in 24 in any given year.\\nTo put it another way, last year, among the roughly 50 million Americans 65 or older, there were 2,067,400 deaths. According to the latest CDC model, about 40,000 Americans 65 or older will die as a result of COVID-19, less than 2 percent of those who would die if there were no virus. Most of those in the 65-plus age who die are the oldest, 80 and above, with underlying conditions, and who have very short additional life expectancy.\\nSo, why is the government shutting down the entire economy to lengthen the average life span of the oldest Americans by a few months at most? Yes, there are a few young people who will be infected and tragically die, but the odds of this happening to any given individual are so small as being almost impossible to measure with any certainty.\\nThe CDC data on death rates show if one is under 35 the chances of dying from COVID-19 is much lower than that of being in a bicycle accident. Why are we not banning bicycles?\\nThe authorities say (in a rare display of good sense) it is OK to shop in grocery stores and drug stores (thank goodness), but these stores sell many items other than groceries, particularly the Walmarts. On the basis of fairness and common sense alone, should not stores that sell anything sold in a Walmart, Target, CVS or Walgreens also be allowed to open?\\nThe Austrian government has decided to gradually reopen its economy beginning this week, with even restaurants slated to open by mid-May. Austria is much richer than most of the other European countries. It lies right in the center of Europe with a population of about nine million. As of today, it has had less than 400 deaths from the COVID-19 virus, even though Italy is on its southern border.\\nOnly 13 U.S. states have had a higher death rate than Austria; in fact, 27 states have had fewer than 100 deaths from COVID-19. Dr. Barbara Kolm, director of the Austrian Economics Center and vice president of the Austrian National Bank, estimates that, even with the re-opening, 30 percent of Austria’s small shops will have gone out of business. A similar fate may well be in store for America’s small shops.\\nThe authorities have said to look at the data — I have — not just the data on the number of new infections and deaths, but the broader mortality data by age group. Continuing with the current mitigation efforts does not even come close to passing a reasonable cost-benefit test. This, without even trying to factor in the number of additional deaths caused by suicides, depression, not being able to afford preventable medical care, etc.\\nThe economic damage from closing down a considerable portion of the United States and worldwide economy will fall more heavily on those least able to cope with it. The increase in U.S. and global debt will have real costs, by reducing the real value of the currency, and, whether the debt problem is taken care of by inflation or additional taxation, real incomes will be lowered.\\nDr. Anthony Fauci and other medical scientists focus, as they should, on policies to mitigate direct deaths from the virus. But their opinions ought not to be given undue weight because they are only focusing on what can be seen — the COVID-19 deaths and not the unseen broader deaths, misery and loss of liberty caused by the economic shutdown.\\nNo matter what actions President Trump and other national leaders take, they will be criticized by the mainstream press and their political opponents for doing too little or too much in reopening their economies. Hence, the leaders ought to pay no attention to the critics and focus on cleaning up the economic mess as soon as possible.\\n• Richard W.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nThe biggest threat to the United States today is not a virus, but rather “virus-shaming.” The greatest challenge the American experiment faces in this dark hour is not our need for safety but our loss of liberty. And the complicity of the church in the wholesale abandonment of this self-evident truth is no less than stunning.\\nWhile governors across the nation fall over themselves to break their oath of office, the church remains quiet. While one mayor after another assumes unilateral power, pastors across the spectrum of denominations shame rather than applaud those who resist such demagogic arrogance.\\nOne retort, in particular, seems ubiquitous in putting freedom’s defenders in their place. “The Bible says we are to obey our government, to ‘submit to every ordinance of man,’ and ‘be subject to the governing authorities.’ How can you ignore these passages?”\\nWell, the answer is, frankly, quite simple. This application of the Bible is truncated and out of context. This exegesis is terrible. This is proof-texting at its worst, for it fails to take into consideration the arc and intent of the biblical narrative.\\nFor example, if Moses had done what this argument suggests, we wouldn’t have the story of Exodus. If Paul had followed this line of reasoning, he wouldn’t have spent so much time in jail, nor would he have lost his head. And what of Gideon, Ehud, Jepthah, Samson and Deborah, who were all charged explicitly by God to resist rulers who had begun to aggregate unto themselves political power at the expense of personal freedom?\\nMoreover, what about those not mentioned in the Bible, but who built their lives upon it? Abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, B.T. Roberts and Harriet Tubman? Were they wrong for defying their government and fighting against the merchandising of men?\\nHow about Martin Luther King Jr.? Was he wrong in his march for civil rights?\\nWas Patrick Henry wrong when he asked, “Is life so dear, or peace [and safety] so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of slavery?” And what of the rest of our Founding Fathers? Were they wrong to put their lives on the line in defiance of King George, who had explicitly promised the colonies his protection and “safety” in exchange for their subservience?\\nYou see, you can’t cherry-pick your Scriptures (or any other literature for that matter) and make your case with integrity. The entire book must be taken into account. And when you do, you’ll find that from beginning to end, it is replete with stories of God’s people defying unjust, oppressive and overbearing governments.\\nIf anything is clear in the history of civilization, as well as that of the church, it is this: When you sacrifice human freedom for the sake of human safety, you almost always diminish the human being. Citizens of the former Soviet Union, for example, may have been “safe,” but this was not the stuff of personal dignity and worth. As the old axiom goes, “A ship in the harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are for,” and so it is with human beings. Safety at the expense of freedom always degrades rather than elevates what it means to be made in the image of God. Michael Ramsden (from the Oxford Center for Christian Apologetics) recently argued that the greatest threat to human beings in the 21st century could, in fact, be a misguided concept of human safety.\\nHe uses this analogy.\\nSuppose, in our mastery of artificial intelligence, that in the near future, we create robots and program them to oversee the safest possible world for human beings, a world that, by definition, is free from all potential harm.\\nThen suppose these robots conclude that, in order to do their job, all human beings must be rounded up and confined 24/7 in dark cells, totally removed from any and all danger, disease and disaster.\\nNow, suppose these robots quickly learn that the “best way” to keep us alive and well, for decades on end, is to feed and medicate us intravenously in our sterile and disease-free cells.\\nWhat kind of world would this be? Is this a nation in which we want to live? Is this our ideal? Such an existence would be “safe,” but would it be good?\\nAt the end of the day, we must decide if liberty is an assumed predicate to the definition of what it means to be human. If, to the contrary, we determine that “safety” is our only non-negotiable, then we need to amend our Declaration of Independence, as well as our Bibles, quickly.\\nAnd while we’re at it, let’s strike “Give me liberty, or give me death” from our nation’s lexicon and replace it with, “I fear death, so take my liberty!”\\n• Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of “Not A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth” (Regnery 2017).',\n",

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nThe biggest threat to the United States today is not a virus, but rather “virus-shaming.” The greatest challenge the American experiment faces in this dark hour is not our need for safety but our loss of liberty. And the complicity of the church in the wholesale abandonment of this self-evident truth is no less than stunning.\\nWhile governors across the nation fall over themselves to break their oath of office, the church remains quiet. While one mayor after another assumes unilateral power, pastors across the spectrum of denominations shame rather than applaud those who resist such demagogic arrogance.\\nOne retort, in particular, seems ubiquitous in putting freedom’s defenders in their place. “The Bible says we are to obey our government, to ‘submit to every ordinance of man,’ and ‘be subject to the governing authorities.’ How can you ignore these passages?”\\nWell, the answer is, frankly, quite simple. This application of the Bible is truncated and out of context. This exegesis is terrible. This is proof-texting at its worst, for it fails to take into consideration the arc and intent of the biblical narrative.\\nFor example, if Moses had done what this argument suggests, we wouldn’t have the story of Exodus. If Paul had followed this line of reasoning, he wouldn’t have spent so much time in jail, nor would he have lost his head. And what of Gideon, Ehud, Jepthah, Samson and Deborah, who were all charged explicitly by God to resist rulers who had begun to aggregate unto themselves political power at the expense of personal freedom?\\nMoreover, what about those not mentioned in the Bible, but who built their lives upon it? Abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, B.T. Roberts and Harriet Tubman? Were they wrong for defying their government and fighting against the merchandising of men?\\nHow about Martin Luther King Jr.? Was he wrong in his march for civil rights?\\nWas Patrick Henry wrong when he asked, “Is life so dear, or peace [and safety] so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of slavery?” And what of the rest of our Founding Fathers? Were they wrong to put their lives on the line in defiance of King George, who had explicitly promised the colonies his protection and “safety” in exchange for their subservience?\\nYou see, you can’t cherry-pick your Scriptures (or any other literature for that matter) and make your case with integrity. The entire book must be taken into account. And when you do, you’ll find that from beginning to end, it is replete with stories of God’s people defying unjust, oppressive and overbearing governments.\\nIf anything is clear in the history of civilization, as well as that of the church, it is this: When you sacrifice human freedom for the sake of human safety, you almost always diminish the human being. Citizens of the former Soviet Union, for example, may have been “safe,” but this was not the stuff of personal dignity and worth. As the old axiom goes, “A ship in the harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are for,” and so it is with human beings. Safety at the expense of freedom always degrades rather than elevates what it means to be made in the image of God. Michael Ramsden (from the Oxford Center for Christian Apologetics) recently argued that the greatest threat to human beings in the 21st century could, in fact, be a misguided concept of human safety.\\nHe uses this analogy.\\nSuppose, in our mastery of artificial intelligence, that in the near future, we create robots and program them to oversee the safest possible world for human beings, a world that, by definition, is free from all potential harm.\\nThen suppose these robots conclude that, in order to do their job, all human beings must be rounded up and confined 24/7 in dark cells, totally removed from any and all danger, disease and disaster.\\nNow, suppose these robots quickly learn that the “best way” to keep us alive and well, for decades on end, is to feed and medicate us intravenously in our sterile and disease-free cells.\\nWhat kind of world would this be? Is this a nation in which we want to live? Is this our ideal? Such an existence would be “safe,” but would it be good?\\nAt the end of the day, we must decide if liberty is an assumed predicate to the definition of what it means to be human. If, to the contrary, we determine that “safety” is our only non-negotiable, then we need to amend our Declaration of Independence, as well as our Bibles, quickly.\\nAnd while we’re at it, let’s strike “Give me liberty, or give me death” from our nation’s lexicon and replace it with, “I fear death, so take my liberty!”\\n• Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of “Not A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth” (Regnery 2017).',\n",

What makes COVID-19 different for our political future is that we have chosen to almost completely shut down the economy to minimize causalities.\\nPresident Trump has been vilified for initially dismissing the threat as the virus spread from China, but he had help. Well after China was taking aggressive action in Wuhan, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was shaking hands, encouraging visits to San Francisco’s Chinatown and criticizing Mr. Trump’s travel ban on China.\\nOn March 2, New York Gov.

       " '\\nCOVID-19 closely resembles the virus that caused the outbreak of the SARS epidemic in China 17 years ago and was not a surprise to experts in the field, according to a specialist at a leading research center that studied the virus.\\nKenneth Plante, a director at the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, a repository of viruses at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been studying the virus since early February.\\nBoth the 2003 SARS virus and the new strain this year originated from bats in China and mutated in ways that allowed infections in humans, he said.\\n“The interesting thing about this virus is that it does mimic its sibling, the standard SARS coronavirus,” Mr. Plante said.\\nResearchers so far have learned much about the new virus and are working to validate how close its characteristics are to SARS.\\n“Some people have been hypothesizing this virus coming out for years,” Mr. Plante said. “And when it finally did come out, it came out pretty close to what people would expect it to emerge as.”\\nMr. Plante said there are signs the virus is mutating from its original form.\\n“This virus has been actually remarkably stable in our hands,” he noted. “But there is a possibility that we could see some further mutations that could change the [characteristics] of this virus.”\\nResearchers believe the current virus was transmitted from bats to another animal host and then to humans. Another mutation allowed it to spread rapidly among humans.\\nChina’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, after initially agreeing to provide virus samples to the center, declined to supply any samples, Mr. Plante said in the interview late last week. The first U.S. samples were obtained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from a patient in Washington state and sent to the Texas virus center on Feb. 6.\\nThe center has sent the samples on to more than 100 research and diagnostic centers mainly in the United States. The best researchers in the world are working on determining how the virus functions, how it spreads and how it can be stopped.\\n“We already have infectious clones; we already know the receptor,” he said in an interview. “There are animals already in place and with laboratories, repositories that are being collaborative, we are getting a lot of work done very quickly.”\\nThe similarities to the earlier SARS virus, which spread to around 8,000 people worldwide and killed almost 800, are still being studied.\\nBy contrast, the new virus has infected over 680,000 people and caused nearly 32,000 deaths worldwide.\\n“Thankfully, the case fatality rate is lower with this virus, though it does seem to be more transmissible,” Mr. Plante said.\\nThe origin of the virus is still unknown and according to the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, the president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences initially agreed that the Wuhan Institute of Virology would share virus samples with the Texas center. But after some discussions, the provision of samples, “never actually happened,” Mr. Plante said.\\nMr. Plante dismissed the one theory about the virus —  that the virus was being researched at a laboratory in Wuhan, and may have escaped through mishandling of infected animals, or an accidental infection of a lab worker. It also undercuts a Chinese-pushed conspiracy theory that somehow a U.S. Army team participating in the World Military Games in Wuhan last year brought the virus with them.\\n“There’s a lot of conspiracy theories that this came out of a biocontainment facility and things of that sort,” he said. “But these viruses are closely related to bats.”\\n“I’ve seen no evidence this is a virus that came out of a lab,” he added. “This appeared in an area where it was hypothesized to appear.

In a similar vein, the House Oversight Committee urged the Food & Drug Administration to “clear the market” of e-cigarette products.\\nSuch regulation was misguided long before the pandemic developed. In fact, if anything, vaping’s record as a tremendously effective smoking cessation aid makes it as important now as ever. Good coronavirus policy — and good public health policy in general — will leave the vaping market be.\\nTo understand how public health policy is going awry, consider the newly-approved New York state budget. It bans flavored vaping products and prohibits the sale of both conventional tobacco products and vaping products in pharmacies. It also restricts the distribution of e-liquid products only to state-licensed retailers, making online sales of e-cigarettes and other nicotine products to New York residents a Class A misdemeanor.

Because smoking is known to damage lungs and weaken the immune system, smokers are especially likely to contract coronavirus, suffer worse symptoms and undergo respiratory failure.

That’s why many doctors are encouraging smokers to switch to vaping during the pandemic.\\nVaping already has helped many people successfully quit smoking. Smokers who switch to vaping have been twice as likely to quit smoking than those who try other forms of nicotine replacement therapy.\\nAlso, limiting access to vaping products will foster the growth of the vaping black market, which also isn’t good for public health. Almost all of the E-Cigarette and Vaping-Associated Lung Illness (EVALI) cases that dominated headlines last fall were attributable to Vitamin E acetate, a component found in THC-laced black market vaping products. Take away accessible options, especially from visible retailers with reputations to keep, and you force vapers to choose to revert to smoking or pursue potentially dangerous black market products.\\nExpanding the black market and increasing EVALI cases in the coming months couldn’t come at a worse time. Health care resources are stretched incredibly thin in the fight against COVID-19 as it is, and shortages of ICU beds, healthy nurses or other resources mean some patients will not get adequate care. Facilitating exposure to Vitamin E acetate will only further strain health care capacity, risking more deaths — of coronavirus patients and vapers alike.\\nThese regulations intend to improve public health in the long run by reducing nicotine addiction. But that argument assumes e-cigarettes are a kind of “gateway” to conventional smoking, a claim in dire shortage of evidence. Studies associating teen vaping with cigarette use acknowledge the common risk factors that drive young people toward varieties of substances — but there is a severe lack of causal evidence that choosing to vape makes someone more likely to pick up a cigarette. Considering 85 percent of vapers have a smoking history, it’s difficult to conclude that vaping is a cigarette-use time bomb.\\nSound policy would proportion regulation and enforcement to the degree of harm something causes. Because smoking does more damage than vaping, the law should discourage it more. Instead, in some key respects, America is building heavier barriers to vaping than smoking.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nAnti-vaping opportunists are trying to use today’s public health crisis to capitalize on last fall’s public health hysteria. Citing concerns about vapers’ potential susceptibility to COVID-19, several states are looking into including vaping regulation as part of their coronavirus response. In a similar vein, the House Oversight Committee urged the Food & Drug Administration to “clear the market” of e-cigarette products.\\nSuch regulation was misguided long before the pandemic developed. In fact, if anything, vaping’s record as a tremendously effective smoking cessation aid makes it as important now as ever.

Militaries have traditionally been both incubators and transmitters of disease for society at large. The 1918 flu pandemic took a catastrophic toll on young American recruits, and the rate of infection in the military from the new coronavirus is higher than in the U.S. civilian population.\\nThe unprecedented scope of the challenge and the tensions within the military came into sharp focus Tuesday after USS Theodore Roosevelt Capt. Brett E. Crozier sounded the alarm about worsening conditions aboard his vessel. The Roosevelt has been ordered to dock in Guam and now has dozens of confirmed coronavirus cases among the 4,000-member crew.\\nIn an internal Navy letter first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, Capt. Crozier pleaded with Pentagon officials for help in getting all of the Roosevelt sailors off the ship and into quarantined living arrangements for at least the next two weeks.\\nSuch a dramatic move would put 4,000 U.S. sailors and one of the service’s most vital warships out of action for weeks and would have a major impact on American military abilities in the Pacific theater. But it is likely the only realistic option if the Navy hopes to avoid mass casualties aboard the relatively cramped ship, where sailors are physically unable to abide by federal “social distancing” guidelines.\\nNavy officials indicated that they will get the entire crew off the ship and conduct a thorough cleaning of the vessel. That means the ship and its crew are likely to be idled for weeks, if not more.\\nAlthough the Roosevelt is perhaps the most glaring instance, the military is grappling with other challenges across its force. Exercises at domestic training camps are being adjusted to keep service members apart, and major counterterrorism and NATO military drills have been shelved in foreign theaters such as Africa and Europe.\\nThe Air Force is even allowing commanders to relax hair grooming standards because trips to the base barber have become too dangerous.\\nTop military officials have conceded that the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to impact military readiness. If the pandemic intensifies, analysts say, the effect on the armed forces will grow.\\n“My gut feeling is probably six months,” said Dakota L. Wood, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who served two decades in the Marine Corps. “I think that you can have dramatically reduced exercises and training for several months. … We all have a lot of muscle memory; we have recollections of doing certain things certain ways. But over time, that starts to degrade.\\n“At some point, you’re going to start seeing degradation in the military readiness of the units,” he added.\\nMounting impact\\nThe impact of the pandemic on the military grows each day. The Pentagon said Tuesday that at least 1,259 cases had been confirmed among service members, civilian Defense Department employees, dependents of service members and military contractors. Of those, at least four have died and 51 have fully recovered.\\nAt least 65 remain hospitalized.\\nIt’s unclear how many COVID-19 tests the military has administered within its ranks. The responsibility falls to commanders in the field, and in the case of the Roosevelt, it seems virtually certain that Navy leaders will want to test all sailors on board.\\nOfficials also have been blunt in saying they simply can’t predict the lasting impact on the military because of the rapid spread of the virus.\\n“There will be an impact to readiness,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters last week. “I think it’ll be on the lower end as opposed to significant.\\n“But,” he cautioned, “this could change.”\\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper and other top officials insist that the U.S. remains ready and able to fulfill its mission to protect the homeland and American assets abroad. At the same time, however, the list of changes forced upon the military by COVID-19 keeps expanding.\\nIn Europe, military officials this month dramatically scaled down the largest NATO exercise since the Cold War after the Pentagon placed restrictions on the movement of troops around the world.\\nAt least three major military exercises have been canceled in Africa, and Marine officials on Tuesday postponed a major six-month deployment of Marines to northern Australia.\\nAt home, each branch of the military has scaled back some aspects of training exercises under the guidance of Pentagon officials, who say only essential tasks should be continued.\\nAt the iconic Parris Island recruiting depot, the Marine Corps has temporarily suspended the training of all new recruits. Other services have limited or completely abandoned all in-person recruiting efforts and have shifted to an entirely virtual approach.\\nIf that continues over weeks or months, the military will have a lack of new soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines coming into the fold.\\nWorst-case scenario\\nThe worst-case scenario for the military would be the rapid expansion of conditions like those aboard the Roosevelt. If major military bases are forced to essentially shut down or if entire units are put into quarantine for weeks at a time, it would affect U.S. military readiness around the world.\\nIn South Korea, a number of exercises for some 28,000 American troops have been called off and travel has been restricted to bases. Meanwhile, North Korea has launched a number of missile tests in recent weeks and said it is “losing interest” in further peace talks with the Trump administration.\\nIn the Roosevelt’s case, officials say, there is simply no option but to quarantine the entire crew and put the vessel out of service for at least several weeks.\\n“We are not at war, and therefore cannot allow a single sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic unnecessarily,” Capt. Crozier wrote in the letter, according to the Chronicle. “Based on current limitations … [the ship] has instituted limited measures to slow the spread of the disease. We have moved a small percentage of the crew off ship, increased the frequency of thorough cleaning and attempted some social distancing. The current strategy will only slow the spread. The current plan in execution on the [Theodore Roosevelt] will not achieve virus eradication on any timeline.”\\nAdm. J.C. Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said his highest priority is to protect the force but there is no plan to simply pull the ship out of action.\\n“I have a mission to maintain warfighting readiness to execute the Navy’s mission,” Adm. Aquilino told reporters Tuesday, but “we want to make sure that we understand exactly what the leader on the ground needs.”\\nActing Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly said limited space in Guam is complicating the logistical challenges for the ailing ship.\\n“The problem is that Guam doesn’t have enough beds right now, so we’re having to talk to the government there to see if we can get some hotel space, create some tent-type facilities there,” Mr. Modly said in an interview with CNN.\\nUnlike with other aspects of the virus crisis, President Trump has largely given the Pentagon a free hand in trying to contain COVID-19’s impact on the military. Asked Tuesday about the USS Roosevelt, Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, “I’m going to let the military make that decision.”\\nAnalysts say the silver lining for the military will be that each service can return to normal relatively quickly, certainly faster than the civilian economy, once the pandemic passes.\\n“I think it’s a slower curve, measured in weeks instead of months,” said the Heritage Foundation’s Mr. Wood. “The snapback occurs within a month, two at the most.”\\n• Dave Boyer contributed to this report.',\n",

Whether it’s the coronavirus today or an unknown tragedy tomorrow, hard times impact us all. As a faith community, we must pray without ceasing but also live a life of service and serenity that helps others understand how to handle adversity.\\n• Tony Perkins is president of the Family Research Council and is an ordained Southern Baptist pastor.',\n",
       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nIt’s getting downright biblical out there.\\nWith a deadly virus spanning the entire globe, maybe it’s time to take a look at the 10 plagues of Egypt, from the biblical book of Exodus to see how we’re doing.\\n1. Water to blood: Check.\\nLake Meke in Turkey’s central Konya province has dried up and the few remaining puddles in the lakebed have turned red due to the microorganisms present. In Naro-Fominsk, Russia, the Gvozdnya River also turned red after an unknown spillage. “One online comment said pollution had caused a ‘blood river’ at the location, some 50 miles southwest of Moscow,” Britain’s Daily Star wrote.\\nWant more? A lake in the Mexican village of Chichimequillas suddenly turned bright pink. Officials say it might be a combination of sodium, unusual bacteria and gunpowder chemicals, but obviously, it’s plague 1 of the Bible. Closer to home, Lake Salubria (which means “good health”) in Bath, New York, also recently turned red.\\n2. Frogs: Check.\\nIn the English town of Chesterfield, frogs are frightening people by emerging through sinks and drains — and sometimes just lurking on the sides of toliet bowls.\\nIn Florida, toxic toads are invading homeowners’ yards. Cane toads ooze a milky, toxic substance called bufotoxin, which is deadly to cats and dogs if they bite, sniff or lick the giant toads. The toxin is also dangerous for humans, and people should wear gloves and protective gear when disposing of the toads, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\\n“When we all open our front door, it’s not 100 — you’re talking thousands of these little baby frogs,” Palm Beach Gardens resident Carollyn Rice told TV station WPTV, Channel 5.\\n3. Lice / gnats. Check.\\nA few months ago, a lice infestation hit Washington State University in Pullman, east of Seattle. Lice also popped up in a public school system in Quincy, Massachusetts.\\nAs for gnats, yeah, they’re here, too. “Outbreak of biting gnats, black flies in Baton Rouge,” said a recent headline from WBRZ-TV.\\n“Unfortunately, they can’t be controlled with the spraying of insecticides designed to control mosquitoes,” according to a statement from the East Baton Rouge Parish Mosquito Abatement and Rodent Control Center.\\n4. Wild beasts. Check.\\nRabbis have interpreted the word for the Fourth Plague — arov — to mean either wild animals, hornets or mosquitoes.\\nLet’s jump right to hornets. Giant hornets were spotted for the first time in America in December — another gift from Asia, like the coronavirus. The hornets kill upwards of 50 people in China and Japan each year, and they also attack honeybees, which pollinate the fruits and vegetables we eat.\\nScientists fear the hornets, like the stink bugs that emerged in the U.S. several years ago, will soon sweep the nation (again, like the coronavirus).\\nThe Bible also says hordes of wild animals were roving all over the country. And with humans hunkered down, they are.\\n“Animals have started taking advantage of cities as they enter lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic. From New Delhi, India, to Buenos Aires, Argentina, groups of animals including deer and lemurs have started to come out to explore — in search of food or just to play,” The Guardian wrote.\\n5. Pestilence. Check.\\n“The hand of the Lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field,” says plague 5.\\n“COVID-19 may force farmers to kill, throw away livestock,” the Detroit Free Press wrote this month. “Lost demand with the closure or significant slowdown of restaurants, and COVID-19 outbreaks at meat packing plants nationwide, where employees work closely together, have slowed meat processing to a trickle,” the article said.\\n“Millions of farm animals culled as U.S. food supply chain chokes up,” writes The Guardian.\\n“Covid-related slaughterhouse shutdowns in the U.S. are leading to fears of meat shortages and price rises, while farmers are being forced to consider ‘depopulating’ their animals,” the piece said.\\n6. Boils. Not yet.\\n“Festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land,” says plague 6. That hasn’t happened yet.\\nSo perhaps, something to look forward to.\\n7. Hail. Check.\\n“At this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt,” says plague 7.\\n“Large Hailstorm Hits Northeast of Wichita, KS,” said one report. “Storm dumps hail deep enough to plow in Augusta County” in Virginia, said another.\\n“Marionville, Mo. orchard damaged by Sunday’s hailstorm,” said a third. That’s a twofer — hail and pestilence. “Tennis ball size hail hits areas of Northwest Arkansas early Monday,” said a fourth.\\nSo, we got hail.\\n8. Locusts. Check.\\n“Let my people go, so that they may worship me. If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow,” says plague 8.\\n“They’re back: Trillions of locusts descend on East Africa in second wave,” The Washington Post reported on Tuesday.\\n“Two new generations of locusts are set to descend on East Africa again — 400 times stronger,” QZ.com reported.\\nSo, big check mark for locusts.\\n9. Darkness for three days. Sort of.\\n“Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days,” plague 9 says. That hasn’t happened, but then Exodus says: “No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days.”\\nWell, we’ve all been hunkered down for weeks or months, so this one is kinda happening. And there have been power outages amid the lock down. “Residents deal with power outage on top of COVID-19 isolation,” ABC-7 in California wrote last month.\\n“COVID-19 Threatens Outages Scheduled at 97% of U.S. Nuclear Sites in 2020,” PowerMag wrote last month.\\n10. Death of first-born. NO!\\nFinally, some good news. This one hasn’t happened so far, but the Mayo Clinic says, “Although rare, children under age 1 (infants) are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. This is likely due to their immature immune systems and smaller airways, which make them more likely to develop breathing issues with respiratory virus infections.”\\nBut aren’t the elderly really our “first born,” our parents and grandparents? The fatality rate for them is far higher than for any age group.\\nOf course, we don’t really think COVID-19 is bringing the 10 Plagues, buy maybe — just maybe — it’s time for all of us to brush up on the Bible. We’ve got the time — as long as the power stays on.\\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

Concerns about what is taught in public schools — from sex education to incomplete or even biased views of American history, as well as their failure to uphold moral and spiritual principles (and in some cases undermining them) have made home schooling attractive to growing numbers of parents.\\nAccording to the National Home Education Research Institute, “There are about 2.5 million home school students in grades K-12 in the United States … It appears that the home school population is continuing to grow (at an estimated 2 percent to 8 percent per annum over the past few years).”\\nThe United States is not the only country in which home education is increasingly popular.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nSunday, the celebration of Easter went a lot smoother than what many feared would happen.\\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic exploded in the 40 days of Lent leading up to Easter, I was inundated with texts and emails from pastors around the world asking, “Will Easter be canceled this year?” Many didn’t know what to do. These were uncharted waters.\\nSo, to encourage anxious clergy, last Monday I hosted a Global Easter Prayer Gathering for Pastors online. It hit a nerve, as nearly 1.2 million clergy from around the world logged in to participate.\\nI told them that as shepherds we’re called to protect God’s flock, not just feed and lead it, and if they truly loved their congregations, they should tell them to stay home on Easter. “Don’t worry, the quarantine will curtail Easter, but won’t cancel it,” I assured them. “The celebration will be simplified, but not stopped.”\\nJesus’ resurrection was not canceled because it already happened 2,000 years ago, splitting the calendar into B.C. and A.D. Every other event in history, including our birthdays, is dated in relationship to Easter. Why? It proved Jesus wasn’t a liar. Many have claimed to be God but only Jesus offered proof. That’s why 2.4 billion believers celebrated Sunday. Easter gives us the reason for hope, which we certainly need these days. So, what are the lessons we can learn from yesterday’s unusual Easter?\\nFirst, we were not the first Christians to stay at home in fear on Resurrection Day. Jesus’ disciples Peter, John and other early followers did the same on the first Easter. John 20:19 reports “That (Easter) evening, the disciples were huddled together in a home, with the doors locked for fear …” Sound familiar? While the Apostles weren’t afraid of a deadly virus, they were afraid of being put to death by the same Roman authorities who had just crucified Jesus.\\nThere was no giant megachurch celebration to welcome the resurrected Christ. To everyone’s surprise, Jesus just showed up in their homes! I have no doubt that Sunday Jesus did that again in tens of millions of homes because of his most famous promises in Matthew 18:20, ”Wherever two or three come together in my name, I will be there with them.”\\nA second lesson to remember is that “church” is not an event to go to; it is a spiritual family to belong to. Technically, we don’t go to “church.” We go to a worship service. The church is God’s family, composed of those who’ve chosen to love and obey Christ, and God says it’s the only thing on earth that will last for eternity.\\nA third lesson is that while worship is the first purpose of the church, Jesus outlined four additional purposes for his family in the world: fellowship (creating authentic community), discipleship (helping people grow to spiritual maturity), mission (reconciling disconnected people to God) and ministry (serving the needs and hurts of everyone). Right now these other functions are desperately needed, and they require no assembly.\\nI’ve used a C.H.U.R.C.H. acrostic while training pastors to help them remember six things any church can do in a crisis. Each is based on a command of Christ: Calm the anxious. Help the hurting. Uplift the discouraged. Recover the lost. Comfort the grieving. Heal the sick. None of these require assembling together and none are political.\\nA fourth lesson is that this crisis is an opportunity for churches to reset their focus on God’s agenda for his church. Jesus was essentially silent about political involvement. Besides paying taxes, the only thing Jesus mentioned was, “My Kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my followers would fight for it.” The Bible supports the tasks of good government, but the church has the greater task of transforming hearts. Laws are necessary to prevent injustice, but laws cannot change a racist or bigot into a lover of everyone. That requires a change of heart.\\nA final lesson is to remember that the church grew exponentially and became the Roman Empire’s official faith because the Christians courageously and compassionately cared for the sick during the plagues of the second and third centuries. It was the Christian church, not government nor business, that moved into the urban areas and created the first real hospitals during those plagues. The church has been doing health care for 2,000 years. It’s why so many hospitals are named after Christian saints.\\nToday, the Christian church is the largest organization on Earth. Nothing else comes close. With 2.4 billion followers of Jesus – 1 out of every 3 people – the church is bigger than China, Europe and the U.S. combined. It has the largest army of volunteers. It was global 200 years before anyone else thought of globalization and it speaks thousands more languages than does the United Nations. At the Davos World Economic Forum several years ago I said, “Your nation may not see this, but the world is becoming more religious, not less. That’s the reality.”\\nThe church has outlasted every dictator, critic, philosophy, political movement, war and disaster. It will survive an Easter without services. Nothing manmade lasts forever, but a thousand years from today, God’s family will still exist — either here on Earth or in heaven. And Easter will still be celebrated.\\n• Rick Warren is the author of “The Purpose Driven Life,” which has sold more than 50,000,000 copies in 135 languages.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nWould you agree to buy a new motor vehicle without knowing the price? Of course not. Your options are many — sedan, convertible, sports car, SUV, minivan, pickup truck, etc. in many different sizes with different features, including different safety features. Most people do not buy the “safest” vehicle because of both price and the fact that other vehicles may have features they value more.\\nYet, when it comes to options regarding how to deal with the COVID-19 virus, most governors give the people no or, at best, few options. People voluntarily engage in all sorts of risky sports — many of which are much more likely to kill anyone under 65 than COVID-19 (as I described in my column last week). Less than 100 people (out of a population of 328,000 million Americans) under age 24 have died from the virus. It is much more dangerous for them to ride an electric scooter or walk across the street, yet the government has shut down almost all schools in the United States for a virus that is not going to kill the students.\\nWe can see the lives lost to the virus. Every night on TV we are shown people being taken to the morgue. What is rarely mentioned is that the average age of death of the victims is well into the 80s.\\nWhat is not seen are all the lives lost to the restrictions being placed on the people — the careers destroyed, the damage from students not being in school, the damage to people who have spent decades building businesses that are now being destroyed by government mandate, the psychological damage from people being cooped up and unable to have normal human interactions with friends, family, business colleagues or even dating, etc. What price do we put on the loss of freedom?\\nThe great French economist Frederic Bastiat (1801-50) had many important insights, and one of his most famous works was titled “That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen.” Bastiat was a master at making a point by telling a story. A store owner’s young son accidentally broke a window, and the store owner then paid a glazer to fix it.\\nThose who can see only the first-order effect say: “This is good because it gave the glazer a job and income.” Those who can see beyond the first order understand that the shop owner will now have less income to buy other goods such as a new pair of boots, thus depriving the cobbler of a job. The glazer, if not employed repairing the broken window, most likely would be spending his time putting windows in new structures — thus creating new wealth.\\nThose who say we can offset the cost of the government mandated shutdown of productive economic activity by just giving business people and individuals money to replace their losses stemming from the shutdown fail to understand that passing out money without creating wealth, over the long run, makes everyone poorer by debasing the currency.\\nIn my fantasyland, I would make it a requirement that all of those who demand expenditures and restrictions on our behavior to mitigate the virus detail precisely the long-run cost of each restriction or proposed expenditure. If America had a better educated, less ideological and more responsible media, they would be insisting on such information rather than accepting what can be immediately seen as the only fact.\\nAn old friend and fine economist, Jack Albertine, who among other things was executive director of the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress, sent me a note regarding my column of last week, parts of which I repeat here:\\nThe data is clear, the U.S. lockdown did not measurably change the mortality rate in the United States. In addition, the models were wrong, period. Their predictions failed empirically. “Elective” medical procedures were banned so as to allow hospitals to have the capacity to deal with the avalanche of COVID-19 admissions. This was again in response to the models’ predictions. First, “elective” medical procedures are called elective because they are not required to stave off immediate death. They, however, are critically important to maintain the health of the population.\\nAdditionally, the longer elective procedures are put off, the more they become not elective at all. So, we endangered the health of millions of people and to what purpose? The predicted avalanche never came. Hospitals have much unused capacity, and, as one who served for nine years on a hospital board, elective surgery and other procedures are huge money makers for hospitals. So now we have a financial crisis in hospitals.\\nIn Texas, 67 percent of the counties have no COVID-19 virus deaths (which may be typical of many states). New York has suffered 88 deaths per 100,000 people, while Texas has suffered only 2.3 deaths per 100,000. So, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is sensibly, rapidly eliminating unnecessary restrictions and getting his state back to normal, as are a number of other governors — while those who cannot think beyond stage I and who neither understand nor appreciate the importance of economic growth and liberty are depriving their citizens of both.\\n• Richard W.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nTwo theories are circulating about the origin of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\\nThe media are still selling the idea that it probably arose from an  infected bat at an outdoor live-animal food market in Wuhan. That’s also  the Chinese Communist Party’s line.\\nThe media don’t want people thinking that communist researchers at  the Wuhan Virology Institute’s BSL-4 lab might have been directly  responsible.\\nHowever, the most plausible scenario is that the virus was, indeed,  cooked up in the lab. Former CIA officer Clare Lopez makes that case in  her April 20 article “Made in China” for the Citizens Commission on  National Security.\\nBeyond debate is that the communists covered up the outbreak for  weeks — assisted by the World Health Organization (WHO) — as it morphed  into a worldwide pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands and  crushed the world’s economy.\\nNot everyone is unhappy about the latter.\\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) says she’s thrilled by  the crash of the oil industry, which has cost hundreds of thousands of  jobs and could put many U.S. producers out of business.\\n“You absolutely love to see it,” she tweeted. “This along with record  low interest rates means it’s the right time for a worker-led, mass  investment in green infrastructure to save our planet.”\\nWell, this should go over big in the oil and gas patch, including  states that have prospered via fracking, such as Pennsylvania, Ohio,  Texas, West Virginia and North Dakota.\\nAOC’s lurch into green insanity was promptly deleted. But it was only  the latest such blast from the young face of the Marxist wing of the  Democratic Party, which has taken over its host.\\nLast Wednesday, on the new Vice TV talk show “Seat at the Table”  featuring author Anand Giridharadas, AOC urged people to stay unemployed  even after the lockdowns end.\\n“When we talk about this idea of reopening society you know, only in  America does the president — when the president tweets about  ‘liberation’ — does he mean ‘go back to work,’” she said. “When we have  this discussion about going back or reopening, I think a lot of people  should just say no — we’re not going back to that.”\\nWell, OK. Working people of the world unite — you have nothing to  lose but your unemployment benefits, which are in many cases more money  than previously employed people could earn by working.\\nA Portland, Oregon restaurateur opined in The Wall Street Journal  that the $600 federal bonus in the CARES Act on top of regular  unemployment benefits means that he will have great difficulty  attracting his employees back. Line cooks are making $1,016 for not  working, as opposed to a starting salary of around $640 per week. Since  the bonus program doesn’t end until July 31, this provision looks almost  as if it were designed to keep unemployment high.\\nWhy would anyone want to do that? Oh. Right. November.\\nBut on the Republicans’ bright side there’s always AOC and her Squad.  I have a theory about mad scientists concocting viruses in labs. Could  it be that the Republicans have their own version somewhere, maybe in an  abandoned Nike base outside of Washington, D.C.? There, white-coated  Victor Frankensteins are concocting AOC clones to be a sort of virus  within the Democratic Party.\\nTheir first major victory was AOC’s ridiculous Green New Deal, ripe for flatulating cow jokes.\\nNext, they egged Nancy Pelosi into the impeachment fiasco, which was  so flimsy that surveys show it raised President Trump’s stock among  voters.\\nThe next benefit to the GOP was AOC’s aggressive backing of Bernie  Sanders, the Vermont socialist who has pushed the party even to the left  of, well, Nancy Pelosi.\\nAlthough the Sanders campaign was a casualty of the coronavirus  pandemic, with voters demonstrably leery of turning the nation over to a  wild-haired communist, Joe Biden has kowtowed to AOC and the Squad to  keep their left-wing legions happy. This won’t help the Dems attract  independent voters.\\nIn a virtual press conference on Facebook on April 20, AOC clone Rep.  Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts Democrat, called the Trump  administration’s policies “akin to war crimes. Criminal negligence,  science denial, a sluggish response … We just have to reject any calls  for a return to normal because that normal was what was slowly killing  people.” Well, the left has been at war with “normal” for some time  now.\\nAs protests grow across the country over some of the more absurd  lockdown edicts by mostly Democratic officials (fining churchgoers for  sitting in their cars), the left is growing increasingly dependent on  censorship.\\nYouTube and Facebook, which acted admirably last August by removing  communist propaganda aimed against Hong Kong protesters, appear to be  taking a dangerous line against liberty in the United States.\\nIn early March, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that the  social media giant would take down “false claims and conspiracy  theories” about the coronavirus while giving WHO free advertising.\\nFacebook said it would also take down protest notices for “events that defy government’s guidance on social distancing.”\\nYouTube announced that it, too, would remove videos promoting anti-government lockdown protests around the country.\\nDoes this sound like America or some other place halfway around the world?\\n• Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nAmerica’s first responders are truly the heroes of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.\\nUnlike millions like myself who have jobs that afford us the ability to work from home, health care professionals are essential workers on the front lines fighting the battles in our country’s overcrowded hospitals and medical facilities. While most Americans can socially distance from others who may have the sickness, first responders don’t have that luxury. They must physically contact COVID-19 patients on a daily basis to do their duties, leaving them especially susceptible to contracting the virus.\\nFirst responders’ bravery and commitment to caring for our sick country deserves a round of applause, as New Yorkers have been doing for them daily at 7 p.m. for weeks now. Unfortunately, not everyone is joining in the celebration. In the shadows, trial lawyers have already begun scheming about how to get rich off of their heroism through spurious medical malpractice lawsuits. Policymakers must take action to protect America’s front-line coronavirus fighters and reform the tort system in the long-term.\\nIndeed, the COVID-19 crisis seems like a perfect storm for malpractice lawsuits, with countless patients having their procedures cancelled and being crowded out of hospitals. On March 18, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued recommendations for health care providers to delay all elective and non-essential surgeries. Moreover, 49 states and D.C. have taken actions easing licensing and telehealth requirements to practice medicine in their jurisdictions. To address the state’s overcrowded hospitals, New York is allowing medical professionals licensed in other states to treat coronavirus patients during the pandemic.\\nFortunately, leaders on both sides of the aisle are starting to raise the alarm. On Wednesday, a coalition of 23 organizations sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi laying out the potential dangers.\\nIf trial lawyers’ predatory, self-serving agenda succeeds, it will hobble our nation’s economic recovery. Costs will significantly rise on the American people in the form of higher health care bills, reduced competition and access to treatment and care, and increased prices on the goods and services that they need to weather this crisis. Vital industries that support our economy could suffer catastrophic bankruptcies. Worst of all, much of the innovation and capital needed to find cures, both to this disease and the economic devastation posed by it, will face significant delays as well, exacerbating the feelings of hopelessness and despair felt throughout the nation.\\nSome states like Illinois, New Jersey and New York have already taken action, granting immunity to health care workers acting in good faith to treat COVID-19 patients. More states will doubtlessly enact more measures in the coming weeks. On the federal level, many proposals have been floating on Capitol Hill lately, too. Sen. Ben Sasse, for example, introduced a bill that would shield medical professionals working outside their specialties to treat coronavirus patients.\\nHowever, no temporary immunity can fully protect from the creative ways trial lawyers find to push lawsuits forward. When all is said and done, comprehensive tort reform is needed. Solutions like capping the payments from exorbitant and often bogus lawsuits and defining who can be a defendant in class-action cases would do much good.\\nWhen America’s first responders finally hang up their masks after the virus recedes, they should not return home to be hit with frivolous lawsuits from patients and trial lawyers looking for a payday. Lawmakers should step up to enact proactive measures that protect our heroes from potential malpractice suits spurring from their acting in good faith to treat COVID-19 patients. But even this is not enough. As things return to normal, policymakers should look for new ways to overhaul America’s tort system for the sake of sanity.\\n• Casey Given is the executive director of Young Voices.',\n",

The WHO even refused Taiwan access to its resources during this present health crisis, with the Chinese administration once again citing it might use this pandemic as a pretext to gain independence.\\nHowever, its isolation meant its government was free to deploy the policies it deemed necessary.\\nDuring the 2003 SARS epidemic, Taiwan had the highest number of fatalities outside of China and Hong Kong, so it has learned the hard way. This time around it has been able to minimize COVID-19’s effect to only one death and 77 infections, as of March 17.\\nThe WHO strongly advises against travel restrictions, but with cases in China now in decline and Europe designated as the new epicenter for COVID-19, did its open travel policy help facilitate the spread of the disease?\\nItaly is a very good example. How did this European country become the second-largest center of the virus in the world, given that it is about 10 times further from Wuhan than Taiwan? Italy imposed a Chinese flight ban before America did, but was it already too late?\\nEven the WHO’s stated aversion to travel bans seems inconsistent as it also praised China’s decision to lock millions of its citizens into their disease-ridden cities.\\nIts director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, tweeted that “China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.” Opposing travel bans while advocating lock-downs is difficult to reconcile.\\nChina was able to place those strict restrictions because it is an authoritarian communist country, but the WHO is now encouraging other nations to follow this “new standard.”\\nIn Europe, the EU’s “four pillars” — the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor — have all but collapsed with most member countries having closed their borders. France has even imposed a temporary lock-down to try to protect its citizens from the disease.\\nDue to the climate of fear that now exists, driven by 24/7 media coverage, there has been widespread acceptance of national emergencies being called and normal freedoms being suspended.\\nSomething that might help to reduce that panic would be for TV stations to put the daily body counts and infection figures for COVID-19 alongside daily cases of seasonal flu and its fatalities. This would put the scale of this disease in context and make it harder for the two figures to be conflated.\\nInfluenza accounts for up to a half-million deaths worldwide and last year’s number of around 34,000 seasonal flu fatalities in America certainly didn’t get this kind of a response. Indeed, there has never been a reaction to a virus quite like this one.\\nThe N1H1, Spanish flu of 1918, killed upwards of 18 million people, but when N1H1 reappeared as Swine flu in 2009, the fatalities were around 200,000.

With COVID-13, authorities attempted to go a step further and set a new paradigm in reducing influenza cases by taking drastic measures at the outset, on a global level and — apparently — no matter what the economic cost.\\nBut China had already made success almost impossible by covering up cases during the crucial month of December, and maybe even before that.\\nYet from very early on, Taiwan began screening passengers on flights from Wuhan and banned them altogether from Jan. 23. These were just some of the preventative steps it has successfully taken.\\nMost other countries have since been playing catch-up, with China embarking on its drastic lock-down program and the West, taking WHO advice, now following suit — although to a lesser degree.\\nWhat has really panicked governments is that the mortality rates for COVID-19 are reportedly so much higher that seasonal flu.\\nExcept that hasn’t been the case in Taiwan, where daily life seems to go on much as it did before the virus, apart from temperature checks being taken everywhere.\\nCitizens in the West, meanwhile, are having all manner of restrictions placed upon them, and the worst of the pandemic is yet to come.\\nThey are also having to watch as their economies plummet, and their livelihoods start to disappear.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nFor the remainder of the school year, online learning is the new normal for most schools across the country. This shock has created a captive, nationwide audience of families interested in exploring alternative online platforms to keep their kids occupied and on track.\\nOnline groups such as Learn Everywhere were quickly created and immediately attracted thousands of members who are sharing resources with each other, from online music classes for young children to free engineering lessons to empanada recipes.\\nWhile this could be a revolutionary moment in K-12 for virtual learning and homeschooling, it’s hard to know at this point.\\nHere are three possibilities.\\n1) Substantial numbers leave in-person schools and begin a virtual or home-based education full-time\\nMany families will be relieved to send their kids back to brick-and-mortar schools once things return to normal, but it’s possible that a significant number of families who have been exposed to online learning for the first time will find that virtual school works for them. Online charters or home-based programs might see a surge in enrollment next year. That wouldn’t be terribly surprising, considering that over the last decade, both full-time and part-time online learning has grown exponentially.\\nPrior to the COVID-19 shutdowns, more than 2.7 million K-12 students were using digital classes at some capacity and more than 300,000 were enrolled in fully-online statewide and charter schools, and there were more than a million homeschoolers, who often use online curricular supports.\\nMass exposure to good virtual alternatives could entice many new families. After all, research indicates elevated school-related stress levels in teens, high rates of fear for student safety, common concerns that one’s kids are either falling behind or not being challenged enough, and low levels of satisfaction with public schools. Trying out virtual school could convince many American families to take the plunge and leave traditional classrooms.\\n2) Online education and homeschooling remain only marginally influential\\nUnder this scenario, while a small number of students may choose to stay virtual moving forward, most will return to traditional classrooms. While virtual charters are available to some, most students are currently using online services provided by their public or private schools. But these options will likely be rolled back or eliminated once coronavirus risks subside.\\nAfter all, homeschooling or virtual public schooling is not a viable option for a large proportion of American families. That could be because they can’t afford to provide adequate supervision, they don’t feel equipped, or maybe it’s just not the right fit for their kids.\\nMoreover, while there are certainly many individual success stories with virtual public schools, some early research shows mixed academic outcomes and high attrition rates — evidence that may lead many families to conclude that it’s too much of a risk.\\n3) Hybrid schooling becomes more widespread in every sector\\nAn overlooked possibility, and the one I believe to be most likely, is that every school sector uses online education where it works well and serves as an effective supplement to in-person learning. Hybrid models combine in-person elements with online learning and operate under a nontraditional schedule, where kids learn at home for a portion of the week. For more than a decade, hybrid models have been utilized by traditional school districts, private schools, and homeschool communities.\\nAnd these schools have been innovating in all sorts of ways. They’re specializing in vocational pathways with apprenticeships and hands-on robotics training, and catering to specific groups such as disadvantaged and special education students by emphasizing counseling and one-on-one tutoring.\\nUnder this scenario, there’s no mass pivot from one schooling sector to another. Instead, there’s an across-sector integration of virtual components driven by parental demand. Families who don’t want fully virtual or home-based education will recognize certain efficiencies and flexibilities that the virtual approach brings, and schools in every sector will have to adapt. Rigid government requirements around curriculum and school structure will simply have to be loosened.\\nThe roles of teachers in a hybrid model could also change considerably. Relying on online curriculum guides for core material could allow teachers to pivot from heavy lesson preparation to content reinforcement and individualized attention in person. Distance teaching can provide a low-cost avenue for advanced content instructors to reach many different students and for schools to offer a wider range of courses.\\nFor parents, students, teachers and administrators alike, this is an anxiety-ridden time. But if there is any good news, it’s that the current situation has jolted the imaginations of families everywhere as to how education could look different from standard schooling and be better tailored to the needs of their unique child.\\n• Christian Barnard is an education policy analyst with Reason Foundation and a contributor with Young Voices.',\n",

For more than a decade, hybrid models have been utilized by traditional school districts, private schools, and homeschool communities.\\nAnd these schools have been innovating in all sorts of ways. They’re specializing in vocational pathways with apprenticeships and hands-on robotics training, and catering to specific groups such as disadvantaged and special education students by emphasizing counseling and one-on-one tutoring.\\nUnder this scenario, there’s no mass pivot from one schooling sector to another. Instead, there’s an across-sector integration of virtual components driven by parental demand. Families who don’t want fully virtual or home-based education will recognize certain efficiencies and flexibilities that the virtual approach brings, and schools in every sector will have to adapt. Rigid government requirements around curriculum and school structure will simply have to be loosened.\\nThe roles of teachers in a hybrid model could also change considerably. Relying on online curriculum guides for core material could allow teachers to pivot from heavy lesson preparation to content reinforcement and individualized attention in person. Distance teaching can provide a low-cost avenue for advanced content instructors to reach many different students and for schools to offer a wider range of courses.\\nFor parents, students, teachers and administrators alike, this is an anxiety-ridden time. But if there is any good news, it’s that the current situation has jolted the imaginations of families everywhere as to how education could look different from standard schooling and be better tailored to the needs of their unique child.\\n• Christian Barnard is an education policy analyst with Reason Foundation and a contributor with Young Voices.',\n",

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nA reader wrote me and stated that the COVID-19 outbreak was a Communist Chinese plot to destroy Western economies. He had no proof, but he is not alone in thinking that China or someone else intentionally spread the COVID-19.\\nI have my doubts about this conspiracy theory and others like it, as they are the stuff of fanciful thrillers. Of course, many thrillers are based on reality and some thrillers have predicted future events. For example, in Tom Clancy’s 1994 thriller “Debt of Honor,” a modern-day Kamikaze suicide pilot crashed his plane into the Capital Building, anticipating the horrific 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001.\\nIn the thriller, a group of Japanese businessmen take over the Japanese government and go to war with America once again. Perhaps not wishing to offend the Japanese, the producers of the film version of “Debt of Honor” changed the bad guys into Nazis.\\nIn Ed McBain’s 2001 novel “Money, Money, Money,” he had the bad guys use counterfeit money to finance a terrorist plot akin to the 9/11 plot. When McBain’s Middle Eastern character arrived at an American airport he was deeply offended at being profiled as a terrorist — even though he was one.\\nMcBain’s fine crime novel was published just two days before the 9/11 attack. Ed McBain, aka Evan Hunter, said he was on a book promotion tour in Chicago when he heard the news of the 9/11 attack, and he noted the eerie similarity between his novel and the real unfolding events.\\nDean Koontz predicted the COVID-19 outbreak in his 1981 thriller “The Eyes of Darkness.” The novel was about a Chinese military lab that created a new virus as a biological weapon. The lab just happened to be located in Wuhan, China, the place where the COVID-19 outbreak began. Mr. Koontz called the weaponized virus the Wuhan-400.\\nAnd there is Ian Fleming.\\n“Fleming was able to peer beyond the Cold War limitations of mere spy fiction and to anticipate the emerging milieu of the Colombian cartels, Osama bin Laden and, indeed the Russian Mafia, as well as the nightmarish idea that some such fanatical freelance megalomaniac would eventually collar some weapons-grade plutonium,” Christopher Hitchens wrote in his introduction to a series of reissued Ian Fleming novels.\\nIn 1966, a Strategic Air Command B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs collided with a tanker while mid-air refueling over the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain. The tanker’s fuel exploded and killed all four airmen and the B-52 was torn apart, killed three of the bomber’s seven-man crew.\\nThe tragedy was compounded by the loss of the hydrogen bombs. There were fears that a foreign power or criminals had found the missing deadly bombs. Many news organizations took note that the mysterious event was much like Fleming’s 1961 thriller “Thunderball.”\\nIn “Thunderball,” the ninth thriller in the Bond series, the mad-as-a-hatter criminal mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leader of the international criminal organization SPECTRE — the Special Executive for Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion — bribed a NATO pilot to crash a bomber with its two nuclear weapons into the sea off the Bahamas. SPECTRE then recovered the weapons and used them to blackmail the Western nations.\\nThe Western nations responded with Operation Thunderball, led by James Bond in the field, and SPECTRE’s plan was thwarted.\\nThankfully, in real life, the B-52’s bombs were recovered near a Spanish fishing village.\\nIan Fleming also wrote about the spread of a deadly virus as a form of biological warfare in his 1963 thriller, “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” In the 11th novel in the James Bond series, 007 is hot on the trial of Blofeld, in hiding after his plot in “Thunderball” failed.\\nThe world’s most wanted man was in the Swiss Alps disguised as the director of a nonprofit medical clinic that treated young women for severe allergies. Blofeld planned to use the unsuspecting women to return home carrying lab-created viruses to destroy Western agricultural.\\nBoth “Thunderball” and “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” were made into successful films that were fairly faithful to the novels.\\nI suspect that the COVID-19 outbreak was not a diabolical plot. But several sources suspect that the origin of the outbreak was China’s “wet markets,” where local businesses cage and slaughter bats, racoons and other exotic animals that some Chinese fancy as delicacies. Many of these animals carry viruses that can be transferred to humans and some experts contend that bats are the source of COVID-19.\\nThe Communist Chinese government has been accused of initially withholding information and of failing to close the wet markets and their borders, allowing the virus to spread worldwide. Many believe that China’s actions constitute criminal negligence.\\nNow that is the stuff of thrillers.\\n• Paul Davis’ On Crime column covers true crime, crime fiction, mysteries and thrillers.',\n",

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nAs COVID-19 continues, as America’s free market languishes, as America’s entrepreneurial spirit withers away, as Americans’ private businesses fall into bankruptcy and outright close — the Democratic Socialists of America are, quietly, behind closed doors, cheering.\\nThey smell opportunity.\\nOut of crisis, here they come. And there are scores of Democrats in Congress riding the same COVID-19 train as the socialists.\\nThis is red-flag-waving, alarm-call-clanging, sound-the-troops-and-play-the-trumpet warning time for freedom-loving Americans. The chance for socialism to spread its rot, using COVID-19 as cause, is real.\\n“Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change,” the Democratic Socialists of America\\xa0wrote in an early May dispatch posted on the organization’s website. “We knew well before COVID-19 that capitalism was killing us.”\\nSen. Bernie Sanders may have gone the way of failed presidential candidates — again. But the DSA hasn’t disappeared.\\nThey’re like vultures, scouring for death. They’re like buzzards, circling for easy prey. They see the desperate 35 million unemployed as opportunity.\\n“Our job as socialists,” the DSA wrote, “[is] to build a new world on the ashes of the old. … We must organize ourselves and fight.”\\nIt’s interesting the DSA would outright label its members “socialists;” after all, many DSA members, most notably, Sanders, have gone out of their way to insist democratic-socialism is not socialism and democratic-socialists are not socialists. Apparently, the distinction — which never was a real distinction — is no longer necessary. The cloak’s off; secret’s out: DSA admits what most freedom-loving Americans already knew — democratic socialists are one and the same as socialists.\\nWhich is pretty much one and the same as communists.\\nPotatoes, potahtoes — it’s all collectivism, and it’s all in stark defiance of America’s system of rugged individualism, as defined by the nation’s founders in the concept of God-given rights, not government-granted privileges.\\nCOVID-19’s dark economic times are giving these socialists an open door. Americans need to slam it shut before the damage done to freedom is irreversible.\\n“In the wake of this devastation,” said socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in recent remarks reported by the Queens Eagle, “our goal should not be to make things as they were. Our goal should be to rebuild in a way that is just and makes things better for people.”\\nIn her mind, that means big government spending. Big government spending for Medicare for All, healthcare for all.\\n“[A]usterity does not create prosperity. We cannot cut our way to growth,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\\nDemocrats in Congress agree.\\nThe HEROES Act, as Democrats have dubbed it, would take roughly $1 trillion of tax dollars and give them to state and local governments — ostensibly, so these state and local government officials wouldn’t have to make the hard decision of reopening for business, amid coronavirus. They could keep private businesses shut but still collect revenues to keep government in operation.\\nSayonara, free market.\\nThe Heroes Act also calls for an addition $200 billion for essential worker pay; $75 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing; and enough stimulus funds to pay Americans $6,000 per household.\\nIn other words: Stay home.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nAs COVID-19 continues, as America’s free market languishes, as America’s entrepreneurial spirit withers away, as Americans’ private businesses fall into bankruptcy and outright close — the Democratic Socialists of America are, quietly, behind closed doors, cheering.\\nThey smell opportunity.\\nOut of crisis, here they come. And there are scores of Democrats in Congress riding the same COVID-19 train as the socialists.\\nThis is red-flag-waving, alarm-call-clanging, sound-the-troops-and-play-the-trumpet warning time for freedom-loving Americans. The chance for socialism to spread its rot, using COVID-19 as cause, is real.\\n“Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change,” the Democratic Socialists of America\\xa0wrote in an early May dispatch posted on the organization’s website. “We knew well before COVID-19 that capitalism was killing us.”\\nSen. Bernie Sanders may have gone the way of failed presidential candidates — again. But the DSA hasn’t disappeared.\\nThey’re like vultures, scouring for death. They’re like buzzards, circling for easy prey. They see the desperate 35 million unemployed as opportunity.\\n“Our job as socialists,” the DSA wrote, “[is] to build a new world on the ashes of the old. … We must organize ourselves and fight.”\\nIt’s interesting the DSA would outright label its members “socialists;” after all, many DSA members, most notably, Sanders, have gone out of their way to insist democratic-socialism is not socialism and democratic-socialists are not socialists. Apparently, the distinction — which never was a real distinction — is no longer necessary. The cloak’s off; secret’s out: DSA admits what most freedom-loving Americans already knew — democratic socialists are one and the same as socialists.\\nWhich is pretty much one and the same as communists.\\nPotatoes, potahtoes — it’s all collectivism, and it’s all in stark defiance of America’s system of rugged individualism, as defined by the nation’s founders in the concept of God-given rights, not government-granted privileges.\\nCOVID-19’s dark economic times are giving these socialists an open door. Americans need to slam it shut before the damage done to freedom is irreversible.\\n“In the wake of this devastation,” said socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in recent remarks reported by the Queens Eagle, “our goal should not be to make things as they were. Our goal should be to rebuild in a way that is just and makes things better for people.”\\nIn her mind, that means big government spending. Big government spending for Medicare for All, healthcare for all.\\n“[A]usterity does not create prosperity. We cannot cut our way to growth,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\\nDemocrats in Congress agree.\\nThe HEROES Act, as Democrats have dubbed it, would take roughly $1 trillion of tax dollars and give them to state and local governments — ostensibly, so these state and local government officials wouldn’t have to make the hard decision of reopening for business, amid coronavirus. They could keep private businesses shut but still collect revenues to keep government in operation.\\nSayonara, free market.\\nThe Heroes Act also calls for an addition $200 billion for essential worker pay; $75 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing; and enough stimulus funds to pay Americans $6,000 per household.\\nIn other words: Stay home. Stay away from work. Let the government provide.\\nLet the government be the god.\\nThat’s socialism; that’s collectivism; that’s communism. It’s all one and the same, tightly wound, one leading to the other. Leftists will deny, and hope semantics will give them the tools they need to duck and dodge and confuse Americans as to their radical redesign plans for the country.\\nBut make no mistake about it: Socialists are using COVID-19 to reshape, reform and rebuild the country.\\nThat is, they’re trying to destroy America from within — and the only solution is for this country to get back on its free market path, and quick.\\nIf Americans aren’t allowed to take care of themselves, the socialists will quickly create a system where Americans have to rely on government for sustenance. And that will be a hard, if not impossible, system of dependency to break.\\n• Cheryl Chumley can be reached at\\xa0cchumley@washingtontimes.com\\xa0or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

But it’s not as bad as the 2017-2018 flu season, when 80,000 -plus perished. And it’s a long cry from what all the experts were warning about just a few weeks ago: First, they predicted 1.7 million Americans dead; then they redid the models (this time apparently entering a few more “facts”) and said 100,000-240,000 dead.\\nNow, a major model relied on by the White House Coronavirus Task Force predicts about 70,000 dead by the end of August.\\nAnd for that we shut down the U.S. economy?!\\nAs the coronavirus swept across China, then Europe — then everywhere — the U.S. media breathlessly reported every terrifying number, almost gleefully. Their ratings soared, of course, as they scared the hell out of every American, many of whom have stayed home for the last 40 days, emerging only to buy toilet paper, but even then clad in masks and tiptoeing in fear.\\nBut here are some facts:\\n• Fatality Rate\\nA recent Stanford University antibody study estimated the fatality rate from the virus is likely 0.1% to 0.2%. The World Health Organization (WHO) had estimated that the death rate was 20 to 30 times higher and called for isolation policies. On which version do you think the media focused?\\nIn New York City, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, the death rate for people 18 to 45 years old is 0.01%, or 10 per 100,000 in the population. People aged 75 and older, though, have a death rate 80 times that. For children under 18, the rate of death is zero per 100,000. That’s zero.\\n• Health and Age\\nMore than half of the COVID-19 deaths in Europe occurred in long-term care or nursing-home facilities. At least one-fifth of the deaths recorded in the U.S. so far have occurred there.\\nNearly all the patients hospitalized for the coronavirus in New York City had underlying health conditions, according to a recent study.\\n“Health records from 5,700 patients hospitalized within the Northwell Health system — which housed the most patients in the country throughout the pandemic — showed that 94 percent of patients had more than one disease other than COVID-19, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association,” Fox News reported.\\nThe study found 42% of the patients were overweight and 53% had hypertension, and the others suffered from a variety of ailments.\\n• Far More Widespread\\nMillions and millions of Americans have already been infected with the virus — even though the U.S. media continues to report the low numbers provided by Johns Hopkins, which says that 998,000 Americans have contracted the virus as of Tuesday.\\nAn antibody study was conducted last week in New York City and found that 1 in 5 (21.2%) of residents have already been infected with the coronavirus. There are 8.5 million people in New York City, so that would mean 1.8 million New Yorkers have had the virus.\\nAt the time of the study, there were 16,249 deaths in the city attributed to COVID-19, which means the death rate in the city was 0.89% at the time — far lower than reports in the U.S. media.\\nResults of antibody survey last week in Los Angeles found as many as 442,000 Los Angeles County residents might have already been infected with the coronavirus by early April, a number far higher than the 8,000 cases confirmed at the time. The survey suggested that the death rate from the virus could be as low as 0.18% of COVID-19 patients, which means the actual death rate in the city is far lower than reported.\\nThe Daily Mail reported Monday that “coronavirus may kill 70 times fewer patients than official UK death figures suggest, studies have shown.” The Mail said a similar fatality rate — 0.19% — was found in a study of residents in Helsinki, Finland.\\nA study, this one by Dr. Justin Silverman, estimates that there were 8.7 million coronavirus infections in the U.S. between March 8 and March 28. And as of April 17, 10% of Americans have been infected — which is roughly 33 million Americans.\\nThe media has been hyping COVID-19 since Day One, alarming Americans to the point where they voluntarily went along with shutting down the entire economy — a mistake that will likely reverberate for a decade or more.\\nEven as U.S. states begin to re-open — based on the data, which shows a far lower fatality rate than reported and a much wider spread of the virus — the media continue to report on what they deem frightening numbers over the deadly virus.\\nThey aren’t, and it isn’t.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nHindsight is a powerful tool that provides vision and clarity, especially about life and death decisions we make.\\nLooking back over our plan to prevent COVID-19 cases at Liberty University while simultaneously prioritizing the needs of students\\xa0who lacked the resources and accommodations to weather the storm, we seemed to have struck the perfect balance. Our crisis response plan prevented any cases of COVID-19 on our campus, and it serves as a model for other institutions to follow in the future.\\nLet’s face it, the world knows a lot more about preventing and mitigating cases of COVID-19 than we did in March. At the time, state leaders were shifting their guidance on a day-by-day, even hour-by-hour, basis. Since no one today has ever dealt with such a massive response to a pandemic, limits on public gatherings, public school closures, business and retail closings, and stay-at-home orders were all in flux as our leaders were determining their guidelines.\\nBefore our students left for spring break on March 13, I assembled a leadership team to establish a whole-of-campus prevention plan. First, we decided that we should not close down but rather find a safe way to allow our students to continue their education. Then, when the governor limited gatherings, we determined that all classes would be conducted online, taught by faculty from their homes to students back in their homes.\\nWhile this was a massive adjustment, Liberty was ready for it since we have been a leader in online learning for years, having begun our distance-learning program in 1985. In fact, we set a new school record by enrolling our 100,000th student in one academic year in Liberty University Online just this week.\\nWhile this was a great solution for most of our students, we knew a small portion of our residential population — including international students, students with elderly relatives at their permanent residences and students with no other high-speed Internet access — would need to return to their campus home after spring break because they had no place else to go. As a private, Christian university, nothing was going to stop us from providing a safe place for these students to return.\\nOver the course of several days, we formed a very detailed plan to prevent cases of COVID-19 on our campus. We cancelled all prohibited events, limited dining services to take-out only while maintaining strict limits on people waiting in line, blocked use of most of the desks and work stations in the library and computer labs, closed indoor recreational spaces, allowed employees to work from home, enforced strict social distancing rules with campus police and security, and our excellent custodial staff cleaned every touchpoint on campus repeatedly throughout each day.\\nWe left no stone unturned in creating a very safe environment for about 1,500 students (out of approximately 8,000) who returned to live on campus after spring break. We also asked three students who returned from New York, four others who had contact with them, and those students and employees who had contact with anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 to self-quarantine at home or at an off-campus, university-owned former hotel. Even though none had COVID symptoms, they all willingly complied and never contracted the virus.\\nOn Wednesday, May 6, we marked the end of the spring semester at Liberty University when the remaining students left campus for the summer. We were pleased to announce that there were no COVID-19 cases among our students who lived in the dorms or our employees stationed on campus.\\nThe only COVID-19 cases among the university community were off campus, either online students or employees working from home or offices off campus, and their infections were all traced to contacts in the local community or out-of-state, but not to Liberty. This is thanks to a lot of prayers and an aggressive crisis-response plan that took thousands of man hours to plan and implement with a heroic commitment on the part of our leadership team, faculty, staff and students.\\nIn the process, Liberty University created the model that other universities should follow for pandemics. In so doing, we protected our students, faculty and staff from COVID-19 cases that existed in the broader Lynchburg, Virginia, community. We are thankful to God that nobody on campus — faculty, staff or students — was infected with the coronavirus.\\nAs tremendous as these results are, they’re contrary to what was reported by The New York Times on March 29 and again on April 16, claiming we had about a dozen confirmed and likely cases of COVID-19, and The New York Times doubled-down when we demonstrated that their information was completely wrong. In an added irony, their reporter and photographer violated our no trespassing rules that were in place to protect our campus family from COVID-19 that would likely be carried by outsiders.\\nMore than 750 media outlets, led by The New York Times, intentionally misled the public to create the impression that COVID-19 existed at Liberty University — and even implied that Liberty was responsible for a COVID-19 death in the surrounding Lynchburg area. We plan to take legal action against The New York Times, in addition to enforcing the trespass warrants that have already been issued against their staff.\\nAs President Trump has learned while he has deftly commanded the federal response to the pandemic and saved hundreds of thousands of lives, our critics in the media don’t stop their attacks during national crises — they only intensify them.\\nDespite these smears, we are grateful that our pandemic crisis response plan worked, and we intend to share it with other institutions so they may be able to save lives in their communities in the future.\\nWith hindsight, we now have confirmation on what works to protect the health and welfare of our campus family while continuing to serve them; and we are mindful that through a lot of prayers and hard work, we all will see this crisis through to a great American comeback in the near future.\\n• Jerry Falwell Jr. is the president of Liberty University and the co-founder of Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty.',\n",

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nSouth Korea’s response to the coronavirus outbreak appears to have been remarkably successful. Unlike most of the Western world, it has managed to stop the spread of the virus, without shutting down its economy.\\nNow, it has become the first country to successfully conduct a general election during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not entirely business-as-usual for the voters, of course.\\nThe National Election Commission (NEC) established strict health protocols, requiring voters to wear face masks and disposable gloves, maintain social distancing, and pass a temperature check before casting ballots. Those failing the temperature check were required to use special voting stations that were disinfected after each use.\\nEven with these extraordinary measures, more than 17 million South Koreans flocked to the polls on Wednesday. Overall turnout was over 65 percent, the highest in 28 years.\\nOf course, South Korea has a proud history of resiliency in the face of adversity.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nSouth Korea’s response to the coronavirus outbreak appears to have been remarkably successful. Unlike most of the Western world, it has managed to stop the spread of the virus, without shutting down its economy.\\nNow, it has become the first country to successfully conduct a general election during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not entirely business-as-usual for the voters, of course.\\nThe National Election Commission (NEC) established strict health protocols, requiring voters to wear face masks and disposable gloves, maintain social distancing, and pass a temperature check before casting ballots. Those failing the temperature check were required to use special voting stations that were disinfected after each use.\\nEven with these extraordinary measures, more than 17 million South Koreans flocked to the polls on Wednesday. Overall turnout was over 65 percent, the highest in 28 years.\\nOf course, South Korea has a proud history of resiliency in the face of adversity. As The Economist recently pointed out:\\n“Historically, the country has rebounded quickly from economic shocks.

What if COVID-19 isn’t significantly deadlier than regular flu? What if COVID-19 has already spread everywhere possible? Are we engaged in the most expensive public health intervention in history without any possible payback?\\nConsider four points :\\n1. In Italy, where COVID-19 health care planning and medical management has been disastrous, there is a COVID-19 death rate of 124 per million thus far (which is has now slowed drastically according to our models). By comparison, in a typical year, the United States experiences 170 per million deaths from flu and pneumonia.\\n2. Countries that haven’t mandated social distancing measures, such as South Korea and the Netherlands, have lower rates of COVID-19 than China and the United States, who have slammed their cities and economies shut. Even countries as culturally and politically distinct as Iran and Italy have experienced the same 30-day epidemic growth curve flattening, as have the others.\\n3. The cost per death averted from these social distancing measures exceeds $300 million per life prolonged, far greater than the U.S. government’s own valuation of an American life at approximately $7-9 million per life.\\n4. The Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, where the poorest, sickest, and frailest children in the United States are treated, has seen no deaths and only one case. If this virus is as lethal to anyone outside of the typical influenza risk groups (frail elderly, multiple comorbidities, poor lung function, etc.) as people claim, we would have already seen many more cases.\\nSouth Korea implemented the most comprehensive viral testing and contact tracing in the world. The COVID-19 epidemic peaked in South Korea at the beginning of March and, through today, has had 131 COVID-19 deaths. While 131 deaths are alarming, let’s put that in perspective: That is 2.3 deaths per one million Koreans from a respiratory illness that, like the flu, can end in fatal pneumonia.\\nThus, this so-called COVID-19 pandemic would have barely registered among the 170 per one million deaths in the United States from flu and pneumonia. Unfortunately, nowhere in the world were there adequate test kits ready to detect and trace the rapid path of this global pandemic. The lack of statistically valid testing and the absence of serological/antibody testing has led to many false conclusions by physicians untrained in the science of epidemics.\\nAll COVID-19 deaths are tragic. Yet, for every frail or chronically ill person (regardless of age) with underlying medical conditions (whether known or unknown) who succumbs to COVID-19, there are hundreds of people, mostly younger, healthier students and working age adults who will have their lives ruined for months or perhaps years by the economic collapse ostensibly created to control the epidemic. We estimate that the economic disruptions will destroy many more lives than the social distancing and economic shutdown would save.\\nMoreover, our econometric models, updated daily, are showing that new COVID-19 case reports and death reports are slowing drastically everywhere except in the United States, where there are greater variations in state-level test kit availability and significant delays in case reporting capabilities. We project a crest in U.S. reported cases and deaths in the next 3-4 weeks with COVID-19 mortality substantially lower than that for a typical influenza season (although total flu and pneumonia deaths may rise slightly).\\nIt is disappointing that the public officials who implemented these drastic social distancing and economic shutdown measures show such extreme concern for slowing the epidemic without understanding the enormous price that all citizens and residents are already paying. They have resorted to the most expensive, intrusive and wasteful methods to try to flatten the infection curve, without any evidence that such measures work.\\nThe Netherlands encourages its young people to mix socially, work and recreate normally, and create herd immunity while using social isolation measures only for those at highest risk (i.e., elderly with comorbid conditions and the immunocompromised). In the United States, some medical professionals already encourage such measures for chronically immunocompromised individuals, such as those undergoing chemotherapy.\\nKorea uses aggressive contact tracing to find and isolate known cases, but no social isolation measures for the general public. Both of these approaches are more effective and orders of magnitude less expensive than sending everyone home and shutting down the economy. This is public policy by panic.\\n• Joel W.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\n“Flatten the curve!”\\nIt’s the dictum that has come to define the American policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It means reducing the rate of the virus’ spread to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Unfortunately, some hospitals are already on the verge of buckling under the enormous strain. Health care workers on the frontlines of the pandemic are often working grueling, 13-hour shifts and scrambling for more supplies.\\nThey need help. Of course, it’s paramount that policymakers aid in slowing the disease’s rate of spread, with measures like ordering shelter-in-place, banning public gatherings and mandating remote work. But those aren’t the only tools at their disposal here. Small regulatory changes could expand the amount of hospital space and number of care providers, giving the health care system some of the relief it absolutely requires.\\nChanging licensing laws would certainly help. As it stands, medical professionals in other states are often barred from traveling to help other regions because of state laws that don’t recognize licenses earned outside of their borders. As a result, when they move to a new state, these professionals have to reapply — often an expensive and time-consuming process.\\nBut they don’t have that kind of time, and right now, the number of health care workers is lower than it could be. That’s exactly why several governors, like Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, have created temporary measures to expedite the process of getting out-of-state recognition to fit within 24 hours, allowing more health care workers to join in the effort to treat the virus where it’s hitting the nation most. More states should follow their lead.\\nAnd these changes should be permanent.\\nYet, that’s not the only regulation strangling the availability of medical aid. Scope-of-practice laws constantly slap away helping hands. They dictate which medical activities health care workers can perform. Of course there ought to be some regulation in this area, but highly-qualified workers, like nurse practitioners and physician’s assistants, are kept from performing procedures that they’re trained to do out of an overabundance of caution.\\nMost of the evidence, for example, shows that the quality of primary care patients receive doesn’t decline if they are treated by a nurse practitioner instead of a physician. Even better, while it’s increasing access to care, expanded scope-of-practice reduces costs. On the other hand, unnecessarily restrictive scope-of-practice laws do the exact opposite: Raising costs and reducing access. Amid a pandemic, these laws make it that much harder for our health care system to save lives — for no good reason.\\nPolicymakers should actively work to fix this. Gov. Newsom of California has already wisely pushed urgent reforms to the state’s scope-of-practice laws, hoping to give hospitals more flexibility in dealing with a massive influx of patients and help reduce doctors’ workloads. Mr. Newsom’s also created new, easier paths for retired doctors to return to the profession in this time of crisis. He has the right idea.\\nBut that’s not all we can do to help. We also need more physical capacity in our hospitals. For that, we’ll have to reform our certificate of need (CON) laws.\\nRight now, 35 states and the District of Columbia have CON laws, which require existing or potential new hospitals to prove a “demonstrable need” to state and local governments before expanding or opening new facilities. Established hospitals often support these regulations, because they prevent the formation of competitors and give them monopoly power in health care markets. Even under normal times, these regulations are bad news — reducing competition, thus raising prices and reducing access to care. And these certainly aren’t normal times.\\nAs it stands, CON laws are blocking sorely-needed expansions in hospital capacity. Some hospitals have already reached capacity, and some states such as Illinois have CON laws that require a lengthy approval process before an existing hospital can build new beds.\\nNorth Carolina, a state with one of the more restrictive CON law regimes, temporarily suspended those laws two weeks ago, allowing healthcare providers to circumvent the approval process to build new hospital beds. As of March 31, according to the Pacific Legal Foundation, 13 states (in addition to North Carolina) with CON laws have issued temporary suspensions or reforms to allow for a better response to the crisis. States with CON laws still on the books, such as Illinois and Florida, need to follow suit.\\nThese regulations were deadly before pandemic ever hit our shores, and with COVID-19 wreaking havoc on our country, the consequences of these ill-considered policies are even more dire. These regulatory reforms aren’t silver bullets, but they’d certainly make the immediate response of the health care system a little stronger. And amid a pandemic, it could very well save countless lives. There’s no excuse — we have to try.\\n• Alex Muresianu is a Consumer Freedom Fellow at Young Voices.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nMarshal Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto commanded the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II until he was killed in April 1943. Despite the dialogue from the 1970 WWII film “Tora! Tora! Tora!” Yamamoto probably did not say in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.”\\nBut Yamamoto likely either wrote or said something similar: “I can run wild for six months … after that, I have no expectation of success.”\\nYamamoto summed up a general feeling among the Japanese admirals that the huge industrial capacity of the United States — which had been asleep during the Great Depression — along with the righteous anger and frenzy of an aroused American democracy would ensure the destruction of the Japanese Empire in short order.\\nThey were right.\\nIn 1940, there were fewer than 500,000 service members in the U.S. military. At the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, that number had grown to nearly 2.2 million. By 1945, more than 12 million Americans were in the armed services. It was an astonishing mobilization for a nation of fewer than 140 million people.\\nThe United States started the war with seven fleet aircraft carriers and one escort carrier. By war’s end, it was deploying 27 fleet and 72 escort carriers.\\nThe U.S. Navy ended the war with a fleet eight times larger than it was at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The American armada would become larger in total tonnage that all the world’s fleets in 1945 combined.\\nMore incredible, by the end of 1944, the American gross domestic product exceeded the economic output of all the major belligerents on both sides of World War II put together: The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy and Germany.\\nAs we struggle to defeat the coronavirus, an aroused America is talking grandly of restructuring the U.S. economy.\\nPoliticians promise that major industries — pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, rare earths, military technologies — will return home to create millions of new jobs and better protect the population in times of crisis.\\nThere are other vows to recalibrate our relationship with China to ensure that when the next successor to SARS and COVID-19 hits, American lives will not be jeopardized by the duplicity of the Chinese government. At the beginning of the outbreak, Beijing hid the origins, nature and transmissibility of the virus, then lied about its supposedly brilliant control of the epidemic.\\nThe American public is already asking tough questions.\\nDoes the United States really need almost 15,000 people flying in from China each day? At a time when American students owe $1.5 trillion in student loans, is it smart to have some 360,000 Chinese students enrolled in U.S. colleges? Is it safe to fund hundreds of labs on university campuses that conduct joint research with Chinese academics?\\nDoes the United States really wish to curtail fracking, which has made it the largest producer of natural gas in the world and ensured that a quarantined America has plenty of fuel?\\nIs it prudent to release precious irrigation water out to the Pacific Ocean when California is the richest and most diverse producer of food in America?\\nPost-virus America can awake from this epidemic and economic shutdown in one of two different ways.\\nOne, we can wake up as we did on Dec. 8, 1941, to ensure that Americans control their own fundamentals of life — food, fuel, medicine and strategic industries — without dependency on illiberal regimes. The military can refocus our defenses against nuclear missiles, cyberwarfare and biological weapons. On the home front, diversity is fine, but in a national crisis as serious as this one, the unity that arises from confidence in shared American citizenship saves lives.\\nOur other choice is to keep bickering and suffering amnesia, remaining as vulnerable as we were in the past.\\nWe can scapegoat and play the blame game. We can talk not of an America in crisis, but of the virus’ effects on particular groups. We can decide that it is mean or even racist and xenophobic to hold the Chinese government accountable for its swath of viral destruction — and so we will not.\\nWe can ridicule the idea of Americans again making their own things and call it protectionism or economic chauvinism. We can conduct endless congressional inquiries about who said what and when about the virus, and perhaps reopen impeachment.\\nOr we can have bipartisan commissions decide how best to return key industries to the United States, prepare for the next epidemic, and pay down the enormous debt we have incurred to defeat COVID-19.\\nIn other words, the choice is ours whether America awakens as a roaring giant or a crying baby.\\n• Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of “The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won” (Basic Books, 2017).',\n",

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nChina and Russia are not among the commonplace coronavirus panic-peddlers. They are also the principal sources of disinformation on the pandemic. From infection rates to fatalities, from the origins of the virus to casting blame for its global spread, China and Russia have spun webs of disinformation worthy of the Soviet Union.\\nThe outbreak of the virus began last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan. On Dec. 30, 2019 two Wuhan doctors, Li Wenliang and Xie Linka,\\xa0messaged colleagues about a possible SARS-like outbreak. Two days later, Wuhan security officials summoned eight people, including Dr. Li, and forced them to sign statements that they had lied about the outbreak. Ever since, China has consistently lied and suppressed and censored information about what can properly be called the Wuhan virus.\\n(Dr. Li has since died of the Wuhan virus disease. Another dissident, Dr. Ai Fen, director of emergency management at a Wuhan hospital, has reportedly disappeared.)\\nThe Chinese regime claims fewer coronavirus infections than the United States, Spain or Italy. It also claims that, at least over the past two weeks, there have been very few infections — fewer than 50 new infections per day — and no new deaths due to the Wuhan virus.\\nBecause of China’s history of outright lies and well-spun propaganda, we can’t rely on those data. The government data is further challenged by the empirical evidence at hand. It appears, for example, that the number of deaths must be vastly higher — especially in Wuhan itself — because of social media photos showing about 5,000 burial urns delivered over two days to just one Wuhan mortuary.\\nStatements by Wuhan residents to Radio Free Asia have said that the death toll in their city alone is vastly higher than the national total reported by Xi Jinping’s regime.\\nMr. Xi’s regime’s propaganda has been picked up by most of the Western media as proof of China’s claims. That disinformation is the basis for media claims that the United States has the most coronavirus cases on Earth.\\nChina has also claimed that the virus was the product of the U.S. military and somehow spread in China by American athletes. Fortunately, the U.S. media haven’t swallowed that whopper, at least yet. Another bit of Chinese propaganda alleged that the virus originated in Italy. An Internet hashtag making that allegation has reportedly been viewed half a billion times. Meanwhile, China has expelled several U.S. news organizations in its attempt to block accurate reporting of coronavirus infections and deaths.\\nMr. Xi’s regime claims that it has beaten the coronavirus after its citizens suffered fewer than 4,000 deaths and 85,000 infections. It ordered Chinese citizens back to work on March 16, but quickly again ordered businesses such as movie theaters in Wuhan to close.\\nThe aims of China’s disinformation campaign are at least twofold. First, the Chinese disinformation is principally for home consumption. By claiming victory, the Chinese government is attempting to justify the “return to work” order by assuring people that it is safe to do so. Second, by that same victory claim, China seeks to change the media narrative from “China bungled the outbreak” to “China the leader” that deserves accolades and emulation.\\nChina has asserted its scientific leadership by, among other things, sending coronavirus test kits to Spain and the Czech Republic. But those test kits proved ineffective in reliably detecting coronavirus infections and have been discarded.\\nSome among the Western media are proclaiming China the new global leader in fighting the virus, displacing the United States.\\nAt this point, because China’s reports on the virus are taken at face value by most of the media, and because many Europeans insist on sneering at President Trump, China’s disinformation campaign is succeeding.\\nRussia’s expertise in conducting disinformation campaigns goes back to the czarist era. Post-Soviet Russia takes great pride in its disinformation skills. Among Russian government apparatchiks, disinformation is probably the most popular indoor sport.\\nAccording to a Reuters report on a nine-page document authored by the European Union’s European External Action Service, the EU found that Russia is engaging in a massive disinformation campaign. The report quotes the document as stating, “The overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries … in line with the Kremlin’s broader strategy of attempting to subvert European societies.”\\nThe EU document recounted that, in almost 80 incidents, Russian disinformation attempted to magnify Iranian accusations that the virus was created in the United States.\\nRussia’s disinformation campaign has, so far, been far less successful than the Chinese campaign. It hasn’t measurably exacerbated the spreading panic that is consuming nations such as Italy and Spain. That only means that Russia will try new and different disinformation strategies to achieve its goal.\\nThere are many ways to defeat disinformation campaigns such as those being pressed by China and Russia. The best way is to achieve a solution that overwhelms the problem the disinformation seeks to compound. The United States is leading the free nations of the world to solutions such as drugs to treat the Wuhan virus and a vaccine to immunize against it. It’s a safe bet that we will achieve those solutions sooner than Chinese and Russian despotisms will.\\nChina is indeed a global leader in the pandemic.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nAs of the writing of this column, 1,600 people have contracted the coronavirus in the United States. There have been 49 deaths in a nation of more than 300 million people.\\nAs a percentage of the total population, that is statistically, about zero.\\nSo far, this season, there have been 19 million cases of flu in the United States and well over 10,000 deaths. Of the 80,796 total cases of COVID-19 in China, 62,826 have fully recovered. Of the remaining cases, only 4,257 remain critical.\\nEven in the case of the now-infamous quarantined cruise ship, only about 20 percent contracted the illness, and the mortality rate for those was about 2 percent.\\nThis past week, I posted a message similar to what I cite above on my social media with this simple addendum. “I’m not a medical doctor, and I am not suggesting we should be cavalier about COVID-19, but context people, context! Stop the hysteria! Context! Cowboy up! We’ll see far worse than this in our lives!”\\nThe reaction?\\nWell, all hell broke loose.\\n“You have the wrong context,” wrote one Facebook friend. “You’re right; you are not a medical doctor,” wrote another. “The mortality rate for the flu is 0.1%. The mortality rate for the coronavirus is five percent or fifty times higher!”\\nMy response: “Your reaction is a perfect example of my point!

Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Rep.

But that’s hardly the case. Throughout the course of the pandemic, the federal government has shown that it’s incapable of quickly producing and distributing mass quantities of vital health supplies. Worse, empowering the federal government to seize private entities’ intellectual property (IP) could stifle medical progress for years to come.\\nThe bill would create an Emergency Office of Manufacturing for Public Health with the power to issue “non-voluntary licenses” that force drug companies to hand over the intellectual property behind patent-protected drugs deemed necessary to combat the pandemic.\\nIn theory, this would discourage drug companies from charging exorbitant prices for COVID-19 treatments. If they did, the government could simply march in, seize the IP behind the therapy or vaccine, and direct its manufacture, with the goal of selling it cheaply or even giving it away.\\nThe government’s recent efforts to manufacture, distribute or even procure necessary medical supplies shouldn’t inspire much confidence. Consider the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s effort to develop a test for COVID-19. Despite plenty of warning, by the end of February, the CDC had distributed fewer than 4,000 of its 160,000 diagnostic tests. Those tests famously had serious design flaws, which the agency only fixed with the help of a private company.\\nIn January, officials from the Department of Health and Human Services turned down an American medical supply manufacturer that offered to ramp up production of much-needed N-95 masks.\\nEven now, the Food and Drug Administration is taking its sweet time reviewing at-home COVID-19 tests, which has forced state and local leaders to put huge testing efforts on hold.\\nPutting the same federal bureaucracy that has repeatedly botched the nation’s response to the pandemic in charge of producing and distributing new COVID-19 treatments doesn’t make sense.\\nWorse still, empowering the federal government to break intellectual property rights on new medications would devastate drug development. It costs more than $2 billion and takes around 15 years to develop a single new drug. Fewer than 1-in-10 compounds that enter clinical trials end up garnering FDA approval.\\nPrivate companies fund these risky projects because a successful drug offers them an opportunity to earn a sizeable return on their investment, thanks to the period of exclusive sales a patent provides.\\nDozens of private companies working on possible COVID-19 vaccines and therapies have been able to attract billions of dollars in investment because the potential payoff — for them and for humanity — would be huge.\\nThat investment would vanish if Ms. Warren and Ms. Schakowsky were able to seize the patents behind whatever treatments emerge from this research race.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nPoliticians, when they are running for office, claim they love and support small businesses — but many of them lie. Over the last three months, the political class has waged an intense war against those people who have risked their savings and countless time and effort to build viable small businesses — including personal and business services, restaurants, etc.\\nBusiness owners were told that they must shut down because of the spread of COVID-19 — and that mitigation actions such as distance limitations and enhanced cleaning would not be enough — unless, of course, you happen to have a big business like Walmart, Target, a major food chain, Home Depot, etc.\\nMillions of small businesses sell some subset of the same merchandise and services that are sold in the big stores. If you buy a 60-watt lightbulb in CVS, Home Depot or Joe’s neighborhood hardware store and stand six feet from the nearest customer, the chance of contracting COVID-19 is roughly the same. Your chance of dying is much more a function of your age and overall health than where you buy a lightbulb.\\nBut never mind the evidence. The big-store chains love the fact that politicians have made it illegal for smaller enterprises to compete with them. Do you think the politicians might be rewarded for doing the dirty work for the big guys during this political fund-raising cycle? What has been happening has little to do with public health, but much to do with political corruption.\\nIt appears that Jeff Bezos of Amazon — the world’s richest man — has seen his wealth grow by tens of billions over the last three months. When people could no longer go to stores to shop, they had to turn to Amazon and a few of the other online retailers. How much do you think Mr. Bezos is going to donate to the campaigns of those politicians who made him much richer?\\nMr. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, whose daily scary headlines encouraged people to stay home (and not take the chance of going to Amazon’s physical store competitors) — more corruption?\\nPeople are getting wise to the scam of allowing big stores to remain open while criminalizing the small guy for the exact same activity. Fortunately, courts are increasingly siding with the small-business owner — equal protection under the law, etc.\\nBut the COVID-19 racket to destroy small business has not been enough for some politicians. In a number of cities where the riots have occurred, the police have been ordered to stand down or in other ways not to protect small businesses. (Yes, a few big-chain stores have been looted and even burned, but the damage to their bottom line has been minimal compared to the losses suffered by small business owners.)\\nThe response to the riots, by mostly Democratic mayors and governors, has further tilted the balance against the small entrepreneurs who do not have the deep pockets to pay off the politicians with campaign contributions, luxury travel or whatever.\\nMembers of the government establishment and their allies now tell us that it is dangerous and illegal for small businesses to open to serve the wants, needs and desires of the public, and to create jobs — but it is good for people to cluster in large numbers and demonstrate against the police. And oh, if some thousands of small businesses are destroyed in the process, well, that is too bad. It gets worse, some big media like CNN (which is owned by AT&T) encourage mayhem because it boosts ratings.\\nMany political leaders, rather than jailing the looters and arsonists, are pushing to get rid of the police. How do you think that’s going to work out for the neighborhood businesses and the public at large?\\nStudies are being suppressed that show COVID-19 is fatal for relatively few, except for the elderly who are suffering from major health problems — and that many people (perhaps even a majority) seem to have some natural immunity.\\nOne of the best studies was done by Professor Anne Marie Knott of Washington University in St. Louis which I reported on a couple of weeks ago. As could be predicted, she was immediately attacked by those who did not like her message. So, rather than cower to the mob, she expanded her study.\\nThe preliminary data show that those countries, states and localities that were quicker to remove the heavy foot of government from small businesses and others are doing as well, if not better, than others in reducing COVID-19 deaths.\\nSome lessons are already clear. Small businesses should open despite executive orders (which are not laws) to stay closed — then challenge the authorities in court. (People who are fearful can voluntarily stay home.) Those small-business people who are in communities where the laws against looting and arson are not enforced need to form armed community groups for mutual defense, which was common practice before the rise of professional police forces.\\nAnd finally, vote those politicians out of office who refuse to enforce the laws against looting and arson, but seek to restrict individual gun rights — leaving only the rich, well-connected and corrupt with personal security protection.\\n• Richard W.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nHistorically, major wars have fostered profound changes in societies and economies. Today’s China-originating pandemic has created an acute international crisis akin to wartime. The world will not be the same after the pandemic.\\nThe incalculable human and economic toll exacted by the rapid spread of the killer coronavirus promises to shake up global geopolitics, including China’s position in the world. The pandemic’s enduring impacts will likely extend from altering previously dependable supply chains to reshaping bilateral relationships.\\nPresident Donald Trump is right that “the world is paying a big price” for China’s initial, weeks-long cover-up of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan city and other parts of Hubei province. According to a\\xa0South China Morning Post report based on Chinese government data, Wuhan doctors began recording one to five cases daily from November 17, before infection rates spiraled and a raging epidemic unfolded. However, China waited until January 21 to issue its first public warning. By then, the spread of the virus had gone beyond its control.\\nA study based on sophisticated modeling has indicated\\xa0 that if Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of COVID-19 cases in China could have been reduced by 95% and the global spread of the disease limited.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nHistorically, major wars have fostered profound changes in societies and economies. Today’s China-originating pandemic has created an acute international crisis akin to wartime. The world will not be the same after the pandemic.\\nThe incalculable human and economic toll exacted by the rapid spread of the killer coronavirus promises to shake up global geopolitics, including China’s position in the world. The pandemic’s enduring impacts will likely extend from altering previously dependable supply chains to reshaping bilateral relationships.\\nPresident Donald Trump is right that “the world is paying a big price” for China’s initial, weeks-long cover-up of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan city and other parts of Hubei province. According to a\\xa0South China Morning Post report based on Chinese government data, Wuhan doctors began recording one to five cases daily from November 17, before infection rates spiraled and a raging epidemic unfolded. However, China waited until January 21 to issue its first public warning. By then, the spread of the virus had gone beyond its control.\\nA study based on sophisticated modeling has indicated\\xa0 that if Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of COVID-19 cases in China could have been reduced by 95% and the global spread of the disease limited. The virus spread farther and wider because the Communist Party of China (CPC) cared more about its reputation than the people’s suffering.\\nThere is no evidence that the new coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has gone further, actually accusing the president of responsibility for many deaths and comparing him to the Roman emperor Nero, who allegedly fiddled while Rome burned. She has promised a full congressional investigation to hold him responsible when things calm down.\\nThere is no question that the Trump administration was slow in realizing the severity of the threat posed by the Wuhan virus, but so was everyone else … including The New York Times itself. The implication of the charges being made is that others knew better than he and would have taken action earlier.\\nUnfortunately for them, however, there is nothing in the public record to support this contention. In fact, The New York Times itself belittled the idea that the Wuhan virus might be as dangerous as or more dangerous than the seasonal flus that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year and spent far more ink attacking the president for over-reacting by banning air travel to China than criticizing him for not taking the threat seriously.\\nIn fact, the liberal establishment fell into lockstep behind the World Health Organization’s line early on and saw the initial concern expressed by the White House as more evidence of the president’s “racism” and desire to demonize the Chinese. The establishment media spent as much time condemning the president for referring to the spreading virus as the “Wuhan” or “Chinese” virus as wondering what might be done to counteract it.\\nMrs. Pelosi helped lead the attack against the president for his anti-Chinese rhetoric and urged San Franciscans to ignore those who had begun advising they stay away from large crowds and attend the city’s Chinese New Year celebration.\\nMr. Trump’s critics began to claim that he had called the whole thing a “hoax,” which he had not, and attacked those who criticized either the Chinese failure to report accurate details of what was going on in that country. Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, was accused, for example, of spreading a “discredited hoax” when he asked if the virus might not have somehow escaped a research facility in Wuhan rather than having emerged from that city’s “wet market” as Beijing claims. Months later, evidence is emerging that Mr. Cotton may well have been right, but anyone who suggested that China was being less than honest was denounced.\\nWhen the Trump administration began to take matters more seriously, the first reaction of the liberal establishment was to warn of the dangers of over-reacting and using the threat of the spreading virus to curtail American liberties, and when it became obvious that tough quarantine measures might be needed, quickly shifted gears to blame the president for not having acted quickly enough.\\nThis will continue. The fact is that no one got it right in the early days either because they misgauged the danger by relying on inaccurate information from the WHO and Beijing or because there wasn’t enough evidence at the time to suggest things were going to get as bad as they have in the months since. Dr. Anthony Fauci, our lead expert today, was one who suggested in January that we might be facing just another flu virus and at first dismissed the idea that we would impose mass quarantines like those being ordered in China.\\nHe was wrong then and so was the president, but they were neither willfully wrong nor incompetent.

They  are the ones who know what’s best for all the rest.\\nC.S. Lewis once said that “Of all the tyrannies, a tyranny exercised  for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nThe choice before us seems to be no choice at all: Stay inside and have no human contact with another soul, keep businesses closed, denying a livelihood to millions, or step outside and risk death. Though I believe the risk is small when comparing the number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have recovered with the number who have died, fear may be the greater threat.\\nSome of a certain age may recall the fears promoted during the Cold War. There were newspaper stories and TV documentaries about how long survivors of a nuclear war would have to stay inside reinforced shelters until the fallout dissipated to a point it was safe to go out. Then, it was Geiger counters that would determine the level of radioactivity. Today’s Geiger counters are temperature gauges held to our foreheads. Symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing and fever, as well as high-risk factors, such as age and underlying health conditions, are also part of the diagnostic equation.\\nWe are told to frequently wash our hands, not touch our faces, don’t shake hands with anyone, practice social distancing — we can recite these from memory — but then we are also told to stay inside and only go out for “necessities,” such as food and prescriptions.\\nGrocery stores where I shop require masks when entering and one-way traffic aisles. A hard plastic “wall” separates me from the cashier, who is also wearing a mask. Hand sanitizers and wipes are available at the entrance and exit where cart handles are wiped down after each use.\\nIf these practices are almost as good as staying home, why can’t businesses employing these practices, including restaurants and bars, be opened so people can make a living and not rely on government, whose debt now exceeds levels that will never be reduced without spending cuts (and likely tax increases if Democrats win the November election)? Restaurants can place tables 6 feet apart. Those operating in warmer climates could add outside tables, benches and chairs.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nThe choice before us seems to be no choice at all: Stay inside and have no human contact with another soul, keep businesses closed, denying a livelihood to millions, or step outside and risk death. Though I believe the risk is small when comparing the number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have recovered with the number who have died, fear may be the greater threat.\\nSome of a certain age may recall the fears promoted during the Cold War. There were newspaper stories and TV documentaries about how long survivors of a nuclear war would have to stay inside reinforced shelters until the fallout dissipated to a point it was safe to go out. Then, it was Geiger counters that would determine the level of radioactivity. Today’s Geiger counters are temperature gauges held to our foreheads. Symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing and fever, as well as high-risk factors, such as age and underlying health conditions, are also part of the diagnostic equation.\\nWe are told to frequently wash our hands, not touch our faces, don’t shake hands with anyone, practice social distancing — we can recite these from memory — but then we are also told to stay inside and only go out for “necessities,” such as food and prescriptions.\\nGrocery stores where I shop require masks when entering and one-way traffic aisles. A hard plastic “wall” separates me from the cashier, who is also wearing a mask. Hand sanitizers and wipes are available at the entrance and exit where cart handles are wiped down after each use.\\nIf these practices are almost as good as staying home, why can’t businesses employing these practices, including restaurants and bars, be opened so people can make a living and not rely on government, whose debt now exceeds levels that will never be reduced without spending cuts (and likely tax increases if Democrats win the November election)? Restaurants can place tables 6 feet apart. Those operating in warmer climates could add outside tables, benches and chairs. For the fearful, takeout orders could be ramped up.\\nLast Sunday, my wife and I went to a local restaurant. Tables had been removed. We wore masks as did staff behind the counter.

       " '\\nANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nBill Gates, the billionaire who founded Microsoft and, along with his wife, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, just called for a complete and utter shutdown and quarantining of the entire American nation, saying the spottiness of some states doing it and some states not  has put all in coronavirus jeopardy.\\nThis — from the guy who’s poised to make some cool millions in the market chaos of recent weeks.\\nThis — from the guy who practically controls policy at the World Health Organization.\\n“Despite urging from public health experts,” Gates wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece, “some states and counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals. This is a recipe for disaster. Because people can travel freely across state lines, so can the virus. The country’s leaders need to be clear: Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere. Until the case numbers start to go down across America — which could take 10 weeks or more — no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown.”\\nHe then added that the impacts of the new coronavirus could linger another 18 months or so, until a vaccine was developed. Question: So, too, his proposed shutdown?\\nHow nice for the nice billionaire with the multimillion-dollar mansion. Or two.\\nBut for the peons of America, work isn’t an option. It’s food. It’s survival. And getting a handout from the government, while necessary in times of crises, doesn’t make up for a bankrupted business.\\nThe fate of a hard-earned dream shouldn’t rest with a globalist billionaire who’s warning of dire coronavirus consequences to come — all the while making hands-over-fist coronavirus money, all the while holding top dog status in one of the very agencies tasked with sounding alarms on global health crises.\\nIt’s a conflict of interest. At the least, it perceives that way.\\n“The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust disclosed a large investment in The Mexico Fund, a closed-end fund that focuses investments in that country,” Barron’s just reported. “The fund has withered in the face of the market disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.”\\nThe Mexico Fund’s New York Stock Exchange shares fell by 42% in recent weeks; Gates’ trust just bought a 5% stake, to become the fourth-largest investor in the fund. What a buy. Some might say, what a steal.\\nThat’s fine; that’s the capitalistic way: Buy low, sell high, profit, profit, profit in the meanwhile.\\nEven philanthropists can be market-savvy.\\nAt the same time, though, Gates is one of the largest funders of the World Health Organization, one of the forefront agencies to warn, advise and counsel governments of the globe on matters pertinent to epidemics and pandemics. On matters pertinent to the WHO-declared pandemic.\\nBut WHO didn’t always see the coronavirus as a pandemic.\\nAs a matter of fact, WHO didn’t announce the coronavirus as a pandemic until the very day after Gates — who had wished for some time that WHO would declare the coronavirus a pandemic — well, until the very day after Gates made a very large donation to a cause that benefits WHO.\\nTake a look at this timeline.\\nOn March 10, Business Insider wrote: “Bill Gates has been sounding the alarm on the COVID-19 coronavirus, calling it a ‘pandemic,’ though the World Health Organization has yet to give it that distinction.”\\nThat was simply an aside to the larger Business Insider article point — which was to announce that “The Gates Foundation, Wellcome and Mastercard are committing $125 million in funding to companies developing treatments for the novel coronavirus” and that “the funding would be used for a COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator” to help speed along coronavirus treatments to the infected.\\nThe Gates Foundation, meanwhile, specified in its own online post that Gates‘ donated portion of the $125 million would be $50 million.\\nThe Gates Foundation also posted this: “The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will work with the World Health Organization, government and private sector funders and organizations, as well as the global regulatory and policy-setting institutions.”\\nThe same WHO and global regulatory and policy-setting institutes that Gates himself heavily, heftily funds.\\nIn a 2017 piece titled, “Meet the world’s most powerful doctor: Bill Gates,” Politico wrote: “Some billionaires are satisfied with buying themselves an island. Bill Gates got a United Nations health agency in Geneva. Over the past decade, the world’s richest man has become the World Health Organization’s second-biggest donor, second only to the United States. … This largesse gives him outsized influence over its agenda. … The result, say his critics, is that Gates‘ priorities have become the WHO‘s.”\\nHave they? Well, let’s see.\\nBack to the timeline.\\nOn March 11, one day after Business Insider reported how Gates had been pushing for a WHO declaration of pandemic on the coronavirus — one day after Gates announced the infusion of millions of dollars into a WHO-partnered venture called COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, that dangled the prospect of putting more regulatory powers into the hands of the global elitists — one day after that, WHO’s director-general made an interesting announcement.\\nOn March 11, at a press conference on the coronavirus, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this: “We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.”\\nCoincidence?\\nPerhaps.\\nBut there’s a lot of money and power and influence to be made with this coincidence. And as Gates‘ quick jump to buy up the bottom-dollar Mexico Trust shows, he’s a guy who’s not at all averse to taking coronavirus lemons and making coronavirus lemonade for himself and his partners. But if perception counts, Gates should pick a side in this coronavirus crisis: Either heal or profit.\\nDon’t do both.\\n• Cheryl Chumley can be reached at\\xa0cchumley@washingtontimes.com\\xa0or on Twitter, @ckchumley.
